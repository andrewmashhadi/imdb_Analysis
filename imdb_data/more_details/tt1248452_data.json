Bones isn't pleased that her father, ex-science teacher Max, is employed in the museum to show kids around, although he does a great job. She gets him fired after he helps Hodgins and Bray with forensic experiments. Cal had a painkiller problem and was employed as a 'nanny'-bodyguard for CEO Richard King's kids, Royce and Alexa, at the exclusive Woodbury school. Upper class families prove interesting suspects. Booth worries if he's giving his boy Parker all possible advantages.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Jessica Landaw","directorList":[{"id":"nm0002506","name":"Jessica Landaw"}],"writers":"Hart Hanson, Kathy Reichs, Carla Kettner","writerList":[{"id":"nm0361274","name":"Hart Hanson"},{"id":"nm1933983","name":"Kathy Reichs"},{"id":"nm0450597","name":"Carla Kettner"}],"stars":"Emily Deschanel, David Boreanaz, Michaela Conlin","starList":[{"id":"nm0221043","name":"Emily Deschanel"},{"id":"nm0004770","name":"David Boreanaz"},{"id":"nm0174819","name":"Michaela Conlin"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0221043","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzNjY2OTYzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzM2Njg0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Deschanel","asCharacter":"Temperance Brennanas Temperance Brennan"},{"id":"nm0004770","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MDA2MTI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI4NDE3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Boreanaz","asCharacter":"Seeley Boothas Seeley Booth"},{"id":"nm0174819","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDU0OTgzY2MtMGQwZi00ZTUzLTg2MDgtNjVkNTAwMTA5NTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3Mjk0OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michaela Conlin","asCharacter":"Angela Montenegroas Angela Montenegro"},{"id":"nm0853231","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjllYTljMjItNjdmYS00NzM5LWI3YjctNDI5ZmZiNzA4NGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODg1MzE3MTQ@._V1_Ratio1.1571_AL_.jpg","name":"Tamara Taylor","asCharacter":"Camille Saroyanas Camille Saroyan"},{"id":"nm0862328","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI0OTMzMzE0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI1MzYyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"T.J.
