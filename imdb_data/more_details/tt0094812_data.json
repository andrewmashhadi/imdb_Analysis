She has narrowed her choice to two recent acquires: Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, the wild neophyte pitcher with a wicked fastball - the pitch on which he solely relies - but can't aim, the more he thinks about it, the more erratic the pitch gets, while he doesn't appreciate anyone criticizing him or it in believing he knows best in his lack of self-awareness; and catcher Crash Davis, the veteran who has been around the minor leagues for twelve years and who was brought in solely to harness and reign in Ebby's power. While Ebby would gladly accept Annie's offer in seeing sex as an inherent part of his being, Crash, who is as philosophical in being a thinker as he is athletic, takes himself out of the running - the first player ever to do so - as, although attracted to her, does not see sex as the \"game\" she seems to treat it, especially as he knows he is nearing the end of his baseball playing career. Part of Annie's initial transformation of Ebby is to give him that nickname he sorely wants - Nuke - to match his pitches. Thus begins Annie, Crash and Nuke's three-way season-long relationship as they evolve because of it as baseball, sexual and human beings.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 7 wins & 6 nominations total","directors":"Ron Shelton","directorList":[{"id":"nm0005421","name":"Ron Shelton"}],"writers":"Ron Shelton","writerList":[{"id":"nm0005421","name":"Ron Shelton"}],"stars":"Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins","starList":[{"id":"nm0000126","name":"Kevin Costner"},{"id":"nm0000215","name":"Susan Sarandon"},{"id":"nm0000209","name":"Tim Robbins"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000126","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1ODkwMTQxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkwNDcyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Costner","asCharacter":"Crash Davisas Crash Davis"},{"id":"nm0000215","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2IyYmE3NjktZTRjYi00YWE3LWIwYjgtOTg1MGZmMmY1ZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODMyNDA5NTQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Susan Sarandon","asCharacter":"Annie Savoyas Annie Savoy"},{"id":"nm0000209","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1OTYxNzAxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTE5ODI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tim Robbins","asCharacter":"Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLooshas Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh"},{"id":"nm0934254","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4MTY3NzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjEyNjAyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Trey Wilson","asCharacter":"Skipas Skip"},{"id":"nm0943237","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODE0Mzg4MDE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTc2OTE1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Wuhl","asCharacter":"Larryas Larry"},{"id":"nm0641640","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM3MjMwNzA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDU3NDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William O'Leary","asCharacter":"Jimmyas Jimmy"},{"id":"nm0624623","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyMjU1YjEtZjg5My00ODRkLTg2ZDMtOGI5OGRkNTY0Y2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Neidorf","asCharacter":"Bobbyas Bobby"},{"id":"nm0304523","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGNiNmE4MGEtNDAyMS00ZjIwLTgxYjQtY2Y4ZmJjZDE1NGQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwODg2MDY@._V1_Ratio1.3714_AL_.jpg","name":"Danny Gans","asCharacter":"Dekeas Deke"},{"id":"nm0797809","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Silardi","asCharacter":"Tonyas Tony"},{"id":"nm0931179","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lloyd T.
