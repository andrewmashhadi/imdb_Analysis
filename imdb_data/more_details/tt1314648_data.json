Manchester, England. A man falls from a third story window. Did he jump or was he pushed? Frank Bannister (Dutch Dore-Boize) knows. He's the only witness, and he aims to keep it that way. It should have been David Marx in flat 311. The hit-and-run driver who killed his father. Frank wasn't looking for vengeance; only justice. Now he'll find neither. Somehow, an innocent man has been killed. A man Frank has never met and has no connection with, but who is more dangerous dead than he ever was alive.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Daniel Austin","directorList":[{"id":"nm2063850","name":"Daniel Austin"}],"writers":"Chris Austin, Daniel Austin, Matthew Austin","writerList":[{"id":"nm2068898","name":"Chris Austin"},{"id":"nm2063850","name":"Daniel Austin"},{"id":"nm2070952","name":"Matthew Austin"}],"stars":"Matt Aistrup, Chris Austin, Simon Brignull","starList":[{"id":"nm3178403","name":"Matt Aistrup"},{"id":"nm2068898","name":"Chris Austin"},{"id":"nm3178737","name":"Simon Brignull"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3178403","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTY3M2JlMzMtNjk5ZC00MjI2LTllYzgtZDA1NTA4MWVlMjIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwNDAyMjc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Aistrup","asCharacter":"Mikelas Mikel"},{"id":"nm2068898","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Austin","asCharacter":"Adrian Linnelas Adrian Linnel"},{"id":"nm3178737","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Simon Brignull","asCharacter":"Garryas Garry"},{"id":"nm2063716","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nathan Byrne","asCharacter":"Tonyas Tony"},{"id":"nm3177458","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nat Clare","asCharacter":"Arresting Officer #2as Arresting Officer #2"},{"id":"nm2401367","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmI0NzRjYTItYzk3ZC00NDY1LWE2NTQtMTgyZDI3ZTQ5Yzk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Denis Crampton","asCharacter":"Walteras Walter"},{"id":"nm1480982","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dutch Dore-Boize","asCharacter":"Frankas Frank"},{"id":"nm1088138","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tony Earnshaw","asCharacter":"Christopher Lentzas Christopher Lentz"},{"id":"nm3184571","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rob Floyd","asCharacter":"Midgeas Midge"},{"id":"nm3178497","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ken Gilkes","asCharacter":"Arresting Officer #1as Arresting Officer #1"},{"id":"nm3178108","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Haigh","asCharacter":"Pavelas Pavel"},{"id":"nm3177739","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mary Hooton","asCharacter":"Milevaas Mileva"},{"id":"nm1921657","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDNjOTAwNjYtNzBkZS00MDBiLWIwYmEtZjBhYmRlMTQzYzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE1ODQyMzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jackie Knowles","asCharacter":"Ameliaas Amelia"},{"id":"nm3178165","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jane Leffman","asCharacter":"Joan Practiceas Joan Practice"},{"id":"nm2884475","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Martin","asCharacter":"Arresting Officer #4as Arresting Officer #4"},{"id":"nm2808815","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steve Murphy","asCharacter":"Shaneas Shane"},{"id":"nm3177905","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Claire O'Brien","asCharacter":"Partygoeras Partygoer"},{"id":"nm3177255","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ron Prentice","asCharacter":"Stefanas Stefan"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","genreList":[{"key":"Crime","value":"Crime"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"}],"companies":"Austin Brothers Films","companyList":[{"id":"co0251454","name":"Austin Brothers Films"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"6.9","imDbRatingVotes":"8","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"It's what's inside that counts.","keywords":"one word title","keywordList":["one word title"],"similars":[{"id":"tt14528052","title":"Cricket","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWFkMjNhMmEtNzhhMC00MmIwLTgzNWItY2YzYmE3ZTIyYjk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzYwMDIwNQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.3"},{"id":"tt13146488","title":"Peacemaker","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODk2NjAyOWMtM2FjZC00MjZhLTkxMjQtZTM3NjJlYTE5MDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.4"}],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
