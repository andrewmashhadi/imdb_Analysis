The audience actively participates in Steve's daily routine and helps solve everyday problems, all within a context of entertaining games and activities. Blue's Clues is designed to develop preschoolers' thinking, reasoning and social skills through an educational approach called \"flexible thinking,\" a theory that recognizes that children need to learn, not just what to think, but how to think for themselves. Blue's Clues uses a play-along format, which encourages kids to actively participate in using the clues as they view the program.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 34
