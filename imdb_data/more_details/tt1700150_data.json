Charlie continues to lie to Shelley proclaiming himself the innocent party. Against Kevin's wishes, Sally tells Sophie that she can't have a dog. Sophie throws a tantrum saying how Rosie gets everything she wants whereas they barely notice her at all. Les is fretting that Cilla may be seeing Uncle Ronnie again. Fiz suggests they wait outside the bingo hall and then they'll know if she's seeing him or not. Liz descends on Karen and Steve saying that she's got nowhere else to stay. Maya and Frankie go for a pizza. Maya's pleased to hear how unnerved Dev and Sunita were to hear that she's been around. When Frankie lets slip that their wedding is set for 25th October, Maya makes a mental note. Sophie's unimpressed when Kevin and Sally tell her that she can have a guinea pig instead of a dog. Chesney tries to hide his amusement. Fiz and Les's plan backfires when he unwittingly chats up Cilla's friend Yana Lumb and discovers that Cilla really has gone to bingo. Dev persuades Sunita to invite her family to the wedding. Maya panics when a Taxi Driver who dropped her at one of her weddings recognises her and starts asking how the wedding went in front of Frankie. She quickly regains her composure and manages to cover, leaving Frankie none the wiser. Fred quizzes Charlie and Shelley about Liz's allegations. Charlie assures him that the whole business was Liz's doing.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"Martin Allen, Tony Warren, Lyn Papadopoulos","writerList":[{"id":"nm0020814","name":"Martin Allen"},{"id":"nm0912726","name":"Tony Warren"},{"id":"nm1580046","name":"Lyn Papadopoulos"}],"stars":"Sasha Behar, Sally Dynevor, Simon Gregson","starList":[{"id":"nm0066885","name":"Sasha Behar"},{"id":"nm0926456","name":"Sally Dynevor"},{"id":"nm0339998","name":"Simon Gregson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0066885","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sasha Behar","asCharacter":"Maya Sharmaas Maya Sharma"},{"id":"nm0926456","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM0MTg2NDc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk5NDM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Sally Dynevor","asCharacter":"Sally Websteras Sally Webster"},{"id":"nm0339998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NTM0NTc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA1NDM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Simon Gregson","asCharacter":"Steve McDonaldas Steve McDonald"},{"id":"nm0347666","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmEwYzMyMWYtY2NlYS00OTFkLWIzMjctMWM1ZTc5YTBkYTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE4NjM3NDA3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shobna Gulati","asCharacter":"Sunita Parekhas Sunita Parekh"},{"id":"nm0427646","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzAyMWRkOTUtOThkOC00ZjVkLWE5MDQtN2U0ZDAzMDIwZGRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bruce Jones","asCharacter":"Les Battersbyas Les Battersby"},{"id":"nm1013087","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzNDMzNzA3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzYwNjY3ODE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Suranne Jones","asCharacter":"Karen McDonaldas Karen McDonald"},{"id":"nm0494663","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NjMxMzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ5ODM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Le Vell","asCharacter":"Kevin Websteras Kevin Webster"},{"id":"nm0962559","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sally Lindsay","asCharacter":"Shelley Unwinas Shelley Unwin"},{"id":"nm0564037","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTAwMTAxNTgwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3ODM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jennie McAlpine","asCharacter":"Fiz Brownas Fiz Brown"},{"id":"nm0624801","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM1NDAzNTk4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg5MTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"David Neilson","asCharacter":"Roy Cropperas Roy Cropper"},{"id":"nm0767644","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjcyMWZmYmQtYTNmZC00OGZjLWEyZGItOGZiYTJkOWEyOTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Savident","asCharacter":"Fred Elliottas Fred Elliott"},{"id":"nm0827228","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTY5MWJhNTgtNDNkMi00NzI3LWEyMzUtMzNlZjI4ZTA3NzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUxMTE1OTY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Debra Stephenson","asCharacter":"Frankie Baldwinas Frankie Baldwin"},{"id":"nm0859480","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDFlZjJlMDgtY2NjZi00N2ZjLTkwOGMtZTViNDZjYzliMTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjA4NTI2MDY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ryan Thomas","asCharacter":"Jason Grimshawas Jason Grimshaw"},{"id":"nm1618068","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDk1NDUxMDMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMzOTI0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Brooke Vincent","asCharacter":"Sophie Websteras Sophie Webster"},{"id":"nm0911408","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5NDgyNDcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk3ODg0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Ward","asCharacter":"Charlie Stubbsas Charlie Stubbs"},{"id":"nm0926654","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4NzQzMjg1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ1MDM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Andrew Whyment","asCharacter":"Kirk Sutherlandas Kirk Sutherland"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Granada Television","companyList":[{"id":"co0103289","name":"Granada Television"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"young adults,elderly people,teenager","keywordList":["young adults","elderly people","teenager"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0053494","seriesTitle":"Coronation Street","seriesFullTitle":"Coronation Street (TV Series 1960â€“ )","seriesYear":"1960","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":null,"episodeNumber":null,"previousEpisodeId":"tt1700319","nextEpisodeId":"tt1700151"},"errorMessage":null}
