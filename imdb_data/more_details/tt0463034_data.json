With a nice house and established careers in tow, nothing seems to get in their way. However, Carl is about find out just how much friendship means when Dupree, his best friend has been displaced from his home and fired from his job because of attending their wedding. Taking his friend in, what Carl and Molly are about to experience is that the fine line between a few days and whatever else is after, can be a lot more than they bargained for. Especially when their friend overstays his welcome in far too many ways than he should.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins & 2 nominations","directors":"Anthony Russo, Joe Russo","directorList":[{"id":"nm0751577","name":"Anthony Russo"},{"id":"nm0751648","name":"Joe Russo"}],"writers":"Michael LeSieur","writerList":[{"id":"nm1942829","name":"Michael LeSieur"}],"stars":"Kate Hudson, Owen Wilson, Matt Dillon","starList":[{"id":"nm0005028","name":"Kate Hudson"},{"id":"nm0005562","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"id":"nm0000369","name":"Matt Dillon"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0005028","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA1NTk0MjMyOTFeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDA4NzEzMTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kate Hudson","asCharacter":"Mollyas Molly"},{"id":"nm0005562","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwMzQ4ODYxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAwMTc2NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Owen Wilson","asCharacter":"Dupreeas Dupree"},{"id":"nm0000369","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzk4NjI3NjQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE3NzI5NzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Dillon","asCharacter":"Carlas Carl"},{"id":"nm0000140","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NzMzOTQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzY1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Douglas","asCharacter":"Mr. Thompsonas Mr. Thompson"},{"id":"nm0736622","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NjgzNzcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExMDYxOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Seth Rogen","asCharacter":"Neilas Neil"},{"id":"nm0221902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY2NTU3ODkyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjI3NjI0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amanda Detmer","asCharacter":"Annieas Annie"},{"id":"nm2110481","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ralph Ting","asCharacter":"Toshias Toshi"},{"id":"nm0823693","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWU3OTA1MmMtMzljMi00OTE3LTg1OGEtODRhOGQ1Mjc2NGExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM3OTQzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Todd Stashwick","asCharacter":"Tonyas Tony"},{"id":"nm0352778","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTY3MzgwMjE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc2MjE3NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Hader","asCharacter":"Markas Mark"},{"id":"nm0035790","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDc2NjE1MDE1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODIwMzE3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lance Armstrong","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0934864","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDQ0ZmEzMDktYjA1Yi00MTVkLWI4ZGMtMzRiMTMwYjc3Yjc3L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM0MDIxNA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Winer","asCharacter":"Eddieas Eddie"},{"id":"nm0490801","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sidney S.
