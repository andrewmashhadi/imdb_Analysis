However, the maid and the cook are expecting \"callers\" for the evening, so Margaret is tucked into the covers with her dolly, the light turned low and a \"help's\" reunion is held on the back porch. Presently mama and papa return from their ride, the \"callers\" hastily exit, the maid assures her mistress she has kept good watch on Margaret and the household retires. Next morning Margaret determines to tell papa of her treatment of the night before, slips from her bed in her pajamas and slippers and, with her dolly in her arms, runs out to the garage, climbs into the back seat of the auto and falls sound asleep. Papa comes in and drives off to business, finds he has to appear in court that morning to bail out a friend and leaves the auto standing before the court-building. Of course Margaret awakens and, dazed by her surroundings, sets up a lusty protest. A kind policeman discovers her, takes the number of the car, learns the address of papa, calls up the house and finds mama and the maid in a state of terror over Margaret's disappearance. Another officer is sent to the house for particulars, while Margaret is taken into the court-room where papa recognizes her and obtains permission to leave at once for home. Of course he is arrested for speeding, taken to another station, mama is informed by phone and, after considerable red-tape. Margaret's little prank is finally straightened out and everybody returns home happy.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"Louella Parsons","writerList":[{"id":"nm0663860","name":"Louella Parsons"}],"stars":"Eva Prout, Lily Branscombe, Joseph Allen Sr.","starList":[{"id":"nm0698976","name":"Eva Prout"},{"id":"nm0105201","name":"Lily Branscombe"},{"id":"nm0020234","name":"Joseph Allen Sr."}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0698976","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzU4NDZlYjktZTYyZS00OWY0LWI0ZjQtY2RiMWNhZDIzYTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eva Prout","asCharacter":"Margaretas Margaret"},{"id":"nm0105201","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTRlNzY3OTktOGMxZi00ZGQyLWFkZGMtYjYxZWZmODJkMGYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lily Branscombe","asCharacter":"Margaret's Motheras Margaret's Mother"},{"id":"nm0020234","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joseph Allen Sr.","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0663832","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmQ4MTA2NWMtYTdjMy00OWI1LTk3NGEtMmRiY2FiZWIyZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Harriet Parsons","asCharacter":""}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","companyList":[{"id":"co0079753","name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"None, English","languageList":[{"key":"None","value":"None"},{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
