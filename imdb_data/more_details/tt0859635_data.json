Farva (Heffernan) is now a construction supervisor, with Mac (Lemme) and Rabbit (Stolhanske) working for him. Thorny (Chandrasekhar) works in logging, and Foster (Soter) is living with his girlfriend and former coworker, Spurbury Police Chief Ursula Hanson (Coughlan). Mac receives a call from his former boss, Captain O'Hagen (Cox), to gather the group and meet for a fishing trip in Canada. Once the group arrives, they find that O'Hagen's intention had been for them to have a meeting with Vermont Governor Jessman (Carter). She explains that during a recent land survey, it was discovered that land in Canada was originally designated for the US. Canada has agreed to hand over the land, and Gov. Jessman needs to set up a police department to take over from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the region. She invites the group to become state troopers again, with the promise that they will become full-time officers should they succeed at this task..","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 2 nominations","directors":"Jay Chandrasekhar","directorList":[{"id":"nm0151540","name":"Jay Chandrasekhar"}],"writers":"Jay
