When a child, Chiron lives with his single, crack addict mother Paula in a crime ridden neighborhood in Miami. Chiron is a shy, withdrawn child largely due to his small size and being neglected by his mother, who is more concerned about getting her fixes and satisfying her carnal needs than taking care of him. Because of these issues, Chiron is bullied, the slurs hurled at him which he doesn't understand beyond knowing that they are meant to be hurtful. Besides his same aged Cuban-American friend Kevin, Chiron is given what little guidance he has in life from a neighborhood drug dealer named Juan, who can see that he is neglected, and Juan's caring girlfriend Teresa, whose home acts as a sanctuary away from the bullies and away from Paula's abuse. With this childhood as a foundation, Chiron may have a predetermined path in life, one that will only be magnified in terms of its problems when he reaches his difficult teen years when peer pressure affects what he and many of his peers do, unless he follows Juan's advice of truly making his own decisions for himself.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 3 Oscars, 228 wins & 296 nominations total","directors":"Barry Jenkins","directorList":[{"id":"nm1503575","name":"Barry Jenkins"}],"writers":"Barry Jenkins, Tarell Alvin McCraney","writerList":[{"id":"nm1503575","name":"Barry Jenkins"},{"id":"nm4144120","name":"Tarell Alvin McCraney"}],"stars":"Mahershala Ali, Naomie Harris, Trevante Rhodes","starList":[{"id":"nm0991810","name":"Mahershala Ali"},{"id":"nm0365140","name":"Naomie Harris"},{"id":"nm5218990","name":"Trevante Rhodes"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0991810","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZThiZjJjNWYtNGRlYS00NDdkLTk0MTMtYjEwYzM1MDExNTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY1MTg4Mzc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mahershala Ali","asCharacter":"Juanas Juan"},{"id":"nm0365140","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyMDU1MTU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkyNzQ3MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Naomie Harris","asCharacter":"Paulaas Paula"},{"id":"nm5218990","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzAwNDEyNTc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEzMzc1MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Trevante Rhodes","asCharacter":"Blackas Black"},{"id":"nm7683379","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzYwMTQ1ODY1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NDc5OTE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alex R.
