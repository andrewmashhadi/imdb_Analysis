At eighteen years old, she is the most protected girl in America; she is the First Daughter. Frustrated with her overprotective father, the President of the United States of America, Anna makes a deal with him: only two agents are allowed to guard her while she attends a concert in Prague. When her father backs out of his promise, Anna flies into a temper and goes on the run with Ben Calder, a handsome photographer she runs into outside of the music club. They travel together with the intention of going to the Love Parade in Berlin. Anna hasn't told Ben who she is but more importantly, Ben hasn't told her who he is. Under the orders of Anna's father, Ben is supposed to keep an eye on the rebellious girl but falling in love with her wasn't something he expected to do. Romance blossoms between the wild, sassy Anna and the cool, distant Ben as they backpack through Europe. Problem is, when it is time to go back and Anna finds out about Ben, what will happen to the two lovers?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 nominations","directors":"Andy Cadiff","directorList":[{"id":"nm0128225","name":"Andy Cadiff"}],"writers":"Derek Guiley, David Schneiderman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0346938","name":"Derek Guiley"},{"id":"nm1447604","name":"David Schneiderman"}],"stars":"Mandy Moore, Matthew Goode, Mark Harmon","starList":[{"id":"nm0601553","name":"Mandy Moore"},{"id":"nm0328828","name":"Matthew Goode"},{"id":"nm0001319","name":"Mark Harmon"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0601553","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5NTEzNDgzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMwNjk4Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Mandy Moore","asCharacter":"Anna Fosteras Anna Foster"},{"id":"nm0328828","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5MDI4NzkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc2MzU0MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Matthew Goode","asCharacter":"Ben Calderas Ben Calder"},{"id":"nm0001319","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NTU3OTU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODg2NDE1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Mark Harmon","asCharacter":"President James Fosteras President James Foster"},{"id":"nm1197466","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQ0MTcyMTY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwOTYzODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Stark Sands","asCharacter":"Grant Hillmanas Grant Hillman"},{"id":"nm1478396","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tony Jayawardena","asCharacter":"White House Guardas White House Guard"},{"id":"nm0005315","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwMDQ0NjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1NzMxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jeremy Piven","asCharacter":"Alan Weissas Alan Weiss"},{"id":"nm0001711","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDZiZjg2MDktOWU5ZC00NzVjLTg5ZTUtMGU4MjA3ZmZmNmU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQxMDc5MzE@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.webp","name":"Annabella Sciorra","asCharacter":"Cynthia Moralesas Cynthia Morales"},{"id":"nm0322035","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZThkMDQ0ODYtYjNjZS00N2Q3LTllMDgtZTYwYTY4MTQ5OWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Briony Glassco","asCharacter":"Photo Motheras Photo Mother"},{"id":"nm1511609","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lily Tello","asCharacter":"Photo Daughter 1as Photo Daughter 1"},{"id":"nm1511571","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tyla Barnfield","asCharacter":"Photo Daughter 2as Photo Daughter 2"},{"id":"nm0255077","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sam Ellis","asCharacter":"Philas Phil"},{"id":"nm0562793","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA4MTQxOTYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYwODQ1MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.webp","name":"Terence Maynard","asCharacter":"Harperas Harper"},{"id":"nm0359391","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lewis Hancock","asCharacter":"Press Secretaryas Press Secretary"},{"id":"nm0353796","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA4Njk1ODY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcxNzAzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Garrick Hagon","asCharacter":"Secretary of Stateas Secretary of State"},{"id":"nm1511488","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Zac Benoir","asCharacter":"Chairmain of the Joint Chiefs of Staffas Chairmain of the Joint Chiefs of Staff"},{"id":"nm0329108","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jan Goodman","asCharacter":"National Security Advisoras National Security Advisor"},{"id":"nm1143236","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5MzY2NjE4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA1MjI3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Robert Ashe","asCharacter":"Chief of Staffas Chief of Staff"},{"id":"nm0328751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTU2MDE0NzMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE2OTg1OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Caroline Goodall","asCharacter":"Michelle Fosteras Michelle Foster"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Alcon Entertainment, Trademark Films, C.R.G.
