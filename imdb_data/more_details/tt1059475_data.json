The bad guy's caught - he just doesn't know it yet. The SRU, inspired by Toronto's Emergency Task Force, is a handpicked team of elite cops. High risk is their business and these men and women do it all: rescue hostages, bust gangs, defuse bombs. Talk down suicidal teens. Protect the Pope. They handle state-of-the-art weapons - sniper rifles, flash-bang grenades, tasers. They climb the sides of buildings. See through walls. But they're different from other SWAT teams. Because their arsenal also includes a gift for words. A knowledge of human intuition. An instinct for when it's time to negotiate - and when the 'solution' calls for something more. On the scene, they're in charge. No one knows their job better. SRU Constables outrank senior Inspectors - and the Inspectors don't like it. Regular uniforms grumble when pushed aside by the SRU 'prima donnas.' While secretly wishing they were in their place. It's a tough job. A job that carries the kind of pressure only your teammates - your band of brothers - can really understand. It's a stress that shades all your choices and can take a heavy toll on families, friends, lovers... These people are A-types and risk-takers. On the job, they play by the rules, bend them if they have to. But off the job, all bets are off...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 22 wins & 88 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Hugh Dillon, Amy Jo Johnson, David Paetkau","starList":[{"id":"nm0227003","name":"Hugh Dillon"},{"id":"nm0005057","name":"Amy Jo Johnson"},{"id":"nm0655959","name":"David Paetkau"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0227003","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTk2Mzg0NDAtZTE5ZS00N2ExLThlZTMtYjA3OGFlYWE2NTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hugh Dillon","asCharacter":"Ed Laneas Ed Lane"},{"id":"nm0005057","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDdlNmY2NTQtZGIzNC00MWU0LTljMjItYWQxMDM5ZGYwZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA3NjkwODU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Jo Johnson","asCharacter":"Julianna 'Jules' Callaghanas Julianna 'Jules' Callaghan"},{"id":"nm0655959","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmE1MjE1NzMtN2Y1MS00MzI0LWExMTctYzY4NjEwNmYzZmM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQzMzA5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Paetkau","asCharacter":"Sam Braddockas Sam Braddock"},{"id":"nm0224391","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzU2ZDUwMWYtZGNmOS00MTQ3LTgxMmMtZGU1Y2JiNjVmMWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIyMjYyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sergio Di Zio","asCharacter":"Michelangelo 'Spike' Scarlattias Michelangelo 'Spike' Scarlatti"},{"id":"nm0170186","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmVmMWE1MDAtZDA5Ni00MTQxLWIwZTItMTY5Y2EzN2ZlNWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMDU4NDk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Enrico Colantoni","asCharacter":"Sgt.
