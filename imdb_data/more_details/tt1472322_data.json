X. They act out their, dominant/submissive relationship with a wildly exotic candelabra performance. Pat is in love. But we discover the challenges she faces in pursuing a relationship with another devoted masochist. With two bottoms in love, there's no one to do the whipping...or to get the coffee. After a wild night on the town dressed up as his alter ego, Gene Pool, Stephen takes us to visit his mother on Vancouver Island. During the trip he describes his parents' marriage, his father's alcoholism and his mother's efforts to raise him and his siblings on her own. During the visit, he is surprised to learn how much his health has affected decisions his mother has made about her own life.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Dennis Heaton, Audrey Mehler","directorList":[{"id":"nm0372773","name":"Dennis Heaton"},{"id":"nm2767178","name":"Audrey Mehler"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"}],"companies":"Paperny Films, Salter Street Films International","companyList":[{"id":"co0101484","name":"Paperny Films"},{"id":"co0099642","name":"Salter Street Films International"}],"countries":"Canada","countryList":[{"key":"Canada","value":"Canada"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-MA","imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0389651","seriesTitle":"Kink","seriesFullTitle":"Kink (TV Series 2001â€“2005)","seriesYear":"2001","seriesYearEnd":"2005","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"4","previousEpisodeId":"tt1472321","nextEpisodeId":"tt1472323"},"errorMessage":null}
