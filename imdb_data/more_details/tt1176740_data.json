So when they find out that Verona is pregnant they take it in stride. Verona is enjoying pregnancy, Burt is already practicing skills that he believes a good father should have, and they live in the same state as Burt's parents Jerry and Gloria so their child-to-be can have grandparents. But when Burt and Verona go to dinner at his parents', they shake up the younger couple with surprising news: they have decided to move to Antwerp, Belgium. Verona lost her parents when she was relatively young, so she is very much alarmed, but the resilient couple quickly find a way to turn it into a positive: they embark on a search for the exact right place for them to raise their daughter-to-be. They go to every place they can think of, meeting family and friends along the way, with laughter and sadness. This is a road trip the parents-to-be will always remember.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins & 10 nominations","directors":"Sam
