She lives with her twenty-something brother/guardian Spencer and produces her webcasts from a makeshift third-floor loft studio. Grappling with adolescence, she never aimed to gain fame as a rising star/underground celebrity to kids. As events unfold in the pilot, it all happens by accident when a teacher puts her in charge of the school talent show. She and her sassy best bud Sam turn the audition process into a show, which Carly's tech savvy smitten friend Freddie tapes - including their hilarious banter and great chemistry - and posts on the Web without telling the girls. The on-line audience clamors for more, and a pop phenomenon blooms, with Carly and sidekick Sam's regular webcasts ultimately featuring everything from comedy sketches and talent contests to interviews, recipes, and problem-solving.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 7 Primetime Emmys, 13 wins & 61 nominations
