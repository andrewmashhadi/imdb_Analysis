Jon accuses Jack of manipulation, inducing one witness and sister of one of his victims to testify against him. On the eve of Jon's execution, Jack receives a phone call telling him that he has only eighty-eight minutes of life, while a killer is copycatting Jon, killing women with the same \"modus-operandi\" and is investigated by Seattle Slayer Task Force. With the support of associate Shelly Barnes, an FBI agent, his friend Frank Parks, and his assistant Kim Cummings, Jack investigates some weird and problematic students, a security guard of the campus and the woman with whom he had one night stand.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 nominations","directors":"Jon Avnet","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000816","name":"Jon Avnet"}],"writers":"Gary Scott Thompson","writerList":[{"id":"nm0860155","name":"Gary Scott Thompson"}],"stars":"Al Pacino, Alicia Witt, Ben McKenzie","starList":[{"id":"nm0000199","name":"Al Pacino"},{"id":"nm0001860","name":"Alicia Witt"},{"id":"nm1360270","name":"Ben McKenzie"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000199","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMzg1ODAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjAxODQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Al Pacino","asCharacter":"Jack Grammas Jack Gramm"},{"id":"nm0001860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzkxNzI5NDkyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1MTgyNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alicia Witt","asCharacter":"Kim Cummingsas Kim Cummings"},{"id":"nm1360270","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODcxMDI3NDQ1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY1Nzg3MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ben McKenzie","asCharacter":"Mike Stemptas Mike Stempt"},{"id":"nm0005447","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4NDc0MzMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTc3Mjk2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Leelee Sobieski","asCharacter":"Lauren Douglasas Lauren Douglas"},{"id":"nm0000312","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODQ3MjkzNTkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4MjgxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Brenneman","asCharacter":"Shelly Barnesas Shelly Barnes"},{"id":"nm0001235","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4MTkxMTMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzkyNDMz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Forsythe","asCharacter":"Frank Parksas Frank Parks"},{"id":"nm0000679","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1NDM3NTMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE5MDkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Deborah Kara Unger","asCharacter":"Carol Lynn Johnsonas Carol Lynn Johnson"},{"id":"nm0568180","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTViNzE5MTItODVkYy00NWZiLThlNDMtZTc4Njg0ZTEwODM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTQ4NzcwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Neal McDonough","asCharacter":"Jon Forsteras Jon Forster"},{"id":"nm1489668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEzMjY0NDYzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NTQwOTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Leah Cairns","asCharacter":"Sara Pollardas Sara Pollard"},{"id":"nm0610459","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGI3ZGViMGQtMThmMS00MDQxLWI2MjYtOTU1Zjk5YjhlZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Moyer","asCharacter":"Guy LaForgeas Guy LaForge"},{"id":"nm0714992","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDAyMjRkMjEtMzE3MC00NWY1LWE3MmYtYmE4MzEyNjk0YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAxNDg2MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Redman","asCharacter":"Jeremy Guberas Jeremy Guber"},{"id":"nm1927763","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg2NzQ2ODYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwNTU5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Trilby Glover","asCharacter":"Defense Attorneyas Defense Attorney"},{"id":"nm0495023","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTM2YTY1ZTYtNWVmZC00YWUxLTk2NDYtODhmNzMxYTQ3MzI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUwMjE5NzIx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Damien Leake","asCharacter":"The Judgeas The Judge"},{"id":"nm0281956","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzUzZDE5MzYtOGY3Zi00MzYyLTlhZmYtOGZkZmZkMzU0M2Q0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.8429_AL_.jpg","name":"Brendan Fletcher","asCharacter":"Johnny D'Francoas Johnny D'Franco"},{"id":"nm1002664","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzEwODcwMDAyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUxNjc1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.4000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Eklund","asCharacter":"J.T.
