Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margaret's life forever.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 2 Oscars, 25 wins & 47 nominations total","directors":"Phyllida Lloyd","directorList":[{"id":"nm1630273","name":"Phyllida Lloyd"}],"writers":"Abi Morgan","writerList":[{"id":"nm0604448","name":"Abi Morgan"}],"stars":"Meryl Streep, Jim Broadbent, Richard E.
