On the brink of demise, eventually, the man will find himself washed ashore on a deserted tropical island of sandy beaches, timid animal inhabitants, and a gracefully swaying bamboo forest. Alone, famished, yet determined to break free from this Eden-like prison, the stranded sailor summons up the strength to build a small raft, and sets off on a perilous journey in the wide open sea; however, an indistinguishable adversary prevents him from escaping. Never giving up hope, each day, the exhausted man attempts to make a new, sturdier, and more improved raft; nevertheless, the sea is vast with wonderful and mysterious creatures, and the island's only red turtle won't let the weary survivor escape that easily. Could this be the heartless enemy?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 13 wins & 34 nominations total","directors":"Michael Dudok de Wit","directorList":[{"id":"nm0240196","name":"Michael Dudok de Wit"}],"writers":"Michael Dudok de Wit, Pascale Ferran","writerList":[{"id":"nm0240196","name":"Michael Dudok de Wit"},{"id":"nm0273863","name":"Pascale Ferran"}],"stars":"Emmanuel Garijo, Tom Hudson, Baptiste Goy","starList":[{"id":"nm0307430","name":"Emmanuel Garijo"},{"id":"nm8940317","name":"Tom Hudson"},{"id":"nm8940318","name":"Baptiste Goy"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0307430","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Emmanuel Garijo","asCharacter":"The Fatheras The Father"},{"id":"nm8940317","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Hudson","asCharacter":"The Son (young adult)as The Son (young adult)"},{"id":"nm8940318","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Baptiste Goy","asCharacter":"The Son (child)as The Son (child)"},{"id":"nm8940319","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Axel Devillers","asCharacter":"The Babyas The Baby"},{"id":"nm5497593","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Barbara Beretta","asCharacter":"The Motheras The Mother"},{"id":"nm2790806","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maud Brethenoux","asCharacter":"Motheras Mother"},{"id":"nm4422335","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"MickaÃ«l Dumoussaud","asCharacter":"Fatheras Father"},{"id":"nm6351965","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elie Tertois","asCharacter":"Sonas Son"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Family, Fantasy","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"}],"companies":"Prima Linea Productions, Why Not Productions, Wild Bunch","companyList":[{"id":"co0093983","name":"Prima Linea Productions"},{"id":"co0049689","name":"Why Not Productions"},{"id":"co0024845","name":"Wild Bunch"}],"countries":"France, Belgium, Japan","countryList":[{"key":"France","value":"France"},{"key":"Belgium","value":"Belgium"},{"key":"Japan","value":"Japan"}],"languages":"None","languageList":[{"key":"None","value":"None"}],"contentRating":"PG","imDbRating":"7.5","imDbRatingVotes":"34553","metacriticRating":"86","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"$21,010","grossUSA":"$921,974","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$6,591,789"},"tagline":"One of the Best Films of the Year!
