This tactic backfired once, when a male guest on a 'secret admirers revealed' episode later killed his admirer after discovering, on camera, that it was another man.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jenny Jones, Maryann Sheridan, Crystal Storm","starList":[{"id":"nm0428360","name":"Jenny Jones"},{"id":"nm3754381","name":"Maryann Sheridan"},{"id":"nm0832550","name":"Crystal Storm"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0428360","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzc5MTE0MzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2Nzc0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jenny Jones","asCharacter":"Self -
