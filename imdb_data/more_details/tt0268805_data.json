In both the present and the past, Lonesome has to rely on his singing skills to survive and avoid trouble. While surviving is not much of a problem, avoiding trouble is more difficult, and the time-travelling cowboy discovers that actions he takes in the past have serious consequences - both negative and positive - on the present... and the future.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Donnelly Rhodes, Tom Cavanagh, Christianne Hirt","starList":[{"id":"nm0722413","name":"Donnelly Rhodes"},{"id":"nm0146915","name":"Tom Cavanagh"},{"id":"nm0386709","name":"Christianne Hirt"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0722413","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODkyNDUxMzQwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODUwODYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Donnelly Rhodes","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0146915","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMzNDI4MTI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY3NTQyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Cavanagh","asCharacter":"Lonesome Cooperas Lonesome Cooper"},{"id":"nm0386709","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0NDQwODI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA4NjU1MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Christianne Hirt","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0657640","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzAyMDkzODAzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM1NTAz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Palffy","asCharacter":"John Marras John Marr"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Romance, Sci-Fi","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"},{"key":"Sci-Fi","value":"Sci-Fi"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"Canada","countryList":[{"key":"Canada","value":"Canada"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"5.2","imDbRatingVotes":"11","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Ken Jubenvill, Wiz Bryant, John Gray","creatorList":[{"id":"nm0431789","name":"Ken Jubenvill"},{"id":"nm0117256","name":"Wiz Bryant"},{"id":"nm0336736","name":"John Gray"}],"seasons":[]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
