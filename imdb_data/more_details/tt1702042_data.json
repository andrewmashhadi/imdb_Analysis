Not having done any traveling, he enjoys living within the comforts of what he knows, basically that being what is purely British. As such, his friends, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant, decide to send Karl to various parts of the world to experience unfamiliar cultures. Stephen believes that travel is a life broadening venture, and hopes that Karl will indeed feel like his life is enriched by these travels. Ricky, however, hopes that Karl will hate every minute of his travels. For Ricky, this experiment is the most expensive gag for his own pleasure that he could have conceived.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 8 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Karl Pilkington, Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant","starList":[{"id":"nm1797453","name":"Karl Pilkington"},{"id":"nm0315041","name":"Ricky Gervais"},{"id":"nm0580351","name":"Stephen Merchant"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1797453","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMjQ1OTU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NDE3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Karl Pilkington","asCharacter":"Self -
