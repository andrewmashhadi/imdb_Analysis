Those frustrations boil over into a raucous viral-videoed public confrontation against a restaurant critic who panned his cooking of food that his boss ordered him to make against his instincts. Now with his career ruined, Carl's ex-wife offers an unorthodox solution in Miami: refit an old food truck to offer quality cooking on his own terms. Now with his young son, Percy, and old colleague, Martin, helping, Carl takes a working trip across America with that truck to rediscover his gastronomic passion. With Percy's tech savvy and Martin's enthusiasm, Carl finds that he is creating a traveling sensation on the way home. In doing so, Carl discovers he is serving up more than simply food, but also a deeper connection with his life and his family that is truly delicious in its own way.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 4 nominations","directors":"Jon Favreau","directorList":[{"id":"nm0269463","name":"Jon Favreau"}],"writers":"Jon Favreau","writerList":[{"id":"nm0269463","name":"Jon Favreau"}],"stars":"Jon Favreau, Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson","starList":[{"id":"nm0269463","name":"Jon Favreau"},{"id":"nm0000375","name":"Robert Downey Jr."},{"id":"nm0424060","name":"Scarlett Johansson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0269463","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjcwNzg4MjktNDNlMC00M2U1LWJmMjgtZTVkMmI4MDI2MTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MDI0NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon Favreau","asCharacter":"Carl Casperas Carl Casper"},{"id":"nm0000375","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzg1MTUyNDYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4MTE2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Downey Jr.","asCharacter":"Marvinas Marvin"},{"id":"nm0424060","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3OTUwMDYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNzc3Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Scarlett Johansson","asCharacter":"Mollyas Molly"},{"id":"nm0000163","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc3NzU0ODczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEyMDY5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dustin Hoffman","asCharacter":"Rivaas Riva"},{"id":"nm0000491","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTEyMjMxNDg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczOTY4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Leguizamo","asCharacter":"Martinas Martin"},{"id":"nm0134072","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NzM3MzQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg2MjY4ODE@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Bobby Cannavale","asCharacter":"Tonyas Tony"},{"id":"nm3492402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2M2NWY1M2QtZWM0Zi00ZDQwLWFkYjAtNWIwMDZkZjMwMWNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emjay Anthony","asCharacter":"Percyas Percy"},{"id":"nm0005527","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU2MjcyMDg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMzQwMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sof√≠a Vergara","asCharacter":"Inezas Inez"},{"id":"nm0001624","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzkzNDgzNjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzODA0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Oliver Platt","asCharacter":"Ramsey Michelas Ramsey Michel"},{"id":"nm0781238","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODIyNDE5NDg2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc0NDU5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Sedaris","asCharacter":"Jenas Jen"},{"id":"nm0992289","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4MzkzMDY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU4NjIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Russell Peters","asCharacter":"Miami Copas Miami Cop"},{"id":"nm6418381","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chase Grimm","asCharacter":"Vendoras Vendor"},{"id":"nm3561592","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Will Schutze","asCharacter":"Mr. Bonetanglesas Mr. Bonetangles"},{"id":"nm0762121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODFmYzZkYmItNmZhNi00N2E4LThlYzgtYzE0NTVmN2ViYmI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gloria Sandoval","asCharacter":"Floraas Flora"},{"id":"nm6418382","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jose C.
