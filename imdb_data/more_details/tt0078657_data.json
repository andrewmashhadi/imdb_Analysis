While Terry is putting his life at risk as he tries his hardest to satisfy his employer's demands, Arthur is busy exploiting Terry for all he is worth. When other people hire Terry's services through Arthur, Arthur usually keeps most of Terry's share of the money for himself by misleading the hard-working Terry about the amount of money he (as Terry's agent) is receiving on Terry's behalf.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 5 BAFTA Awards, 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"George Cole, Glynn Edwards, Dennis Waterman","starList":[{"id":"nm0170552","name":"George Cole"},{"id":"nm0250022","name":"Glynn Edwards"},{"id":"nm0913993","name":"Dennis Waterman"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0170552","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2RjY2ViMDgtNTZjZi00OTI0LThhMGEtNTk1MTFlZWM1YTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George Cole","asCharacter":"Arthuras Arthur…"},{"id":"nm0250022","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4NTU4ODEzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgwNDE1NTE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Glynn Edwards","asCharacter":"Daveas Dave…"},{"id":"nm0913993","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwMDY0OTY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQyMDM4OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dennis Waterman","asCharacter":"Terryas Terry…"},{"id":"nm0916894","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2IxZTM0ODgtYmZmYS00MThhLTk1ZDctNTAyZjdmZTNjNGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Gary Webster","asCharacter":"Rayas Ray"},{"id":"nm0538869","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczMjg5MjA4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick Malahide","asCharacter":"Chisholmas Chisholm…"},{"id":"nm0693945","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Povey","asCharacter":"D.C.
