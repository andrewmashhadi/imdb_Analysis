The species dates back to the dinosaurs - more than 60 million years - and they're pure predators, preying solely on other fish for food. Despite this intimidating pedigree, fishermen from all over Oklahoma come to Paul's Valley every summer to compete in the Okie Noodlin' Tournament - a bizarre derby in which anglers are allowed to use only their hands as bait! Bob must dive underwater, place his hand inside a catfish hole, and keep it there until a catfish bites him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"William Morrison","directorList":[{"id":"nm2013296","name":"William Morrison"}],"writers":"Bob Blumer, Aynsley Vogel, Peter Waal","writerList":[{"id":"nm1517378","name":"Bob Blumer"},{"id":"nm3141892","name":"Aynsley Vogel"},{"id":"nm1764644","name":"Peter Waal"}],"stars":"Bob Blumer","starList":[{"id":"nm1517378","name":"Bob Blumer"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1517378","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bob Blumer","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Adventure, Reality-TV","genreList":[{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Reality-TV","value":"Reality-TV"}],"companies":"Glutton Productions, Paperny Films","companyList":[{"id":"co0334304","name":"Glutton Productions"},{"id":"co0101484","name":"Paperny Films"}],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt1239017","seriesTitle":"Glutton for Punishment","seriesFullTitle":"Glutton for Punishment (TV Series 2007â€“ )","seriesYear":"2007","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"2","episodeNumber":"4","previousEpisodeId":"tt1259300","nextEpisodeId":"tt1432598"},"errorMessage":null}
