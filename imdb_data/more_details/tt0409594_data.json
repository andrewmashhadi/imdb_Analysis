Hawaiian-born Jason Matthews runs the hotel as the assistant manager and makes sure every guest gets everything they need. But when former flame, Nicole Booth, arrives as the hotel's new Director of Guest Relations, Jason's world is turned upside down. But the Grand Waimea owner, Vincent Colville, is staying on top of him to make sure his past with Nicole won't affect their work life. Just as interesting as the hotel's wild and crazy clientele is its staff, which is filled with friends, thrill-seekers, con artists, and dreamers in paradise. Waitress M.J. Bevans, Jason's surrogate little sister and roommate, is just waiting for her t-shirt design business to blossom into a fashion empire. Chris Remsen runs an adventure company that caters to Waimea guests. Bartender Frankie Seau keeps those guests well-lubricated while trying to hide a mysterious past. Also included is Gabriel Miller, the young lifeguard trying to carve out a surfing career, and Tessa Lewis, a crafty former con artist/ex-con who's now putting her skills of manipulation and deception to both good and bad use as the hotel's concierge as well as for her own devious agenda to look for any dirt on guests and staff alike for personal gain. Intrigue and excitement await every guest at the Grand Waimea. Just ask the staff.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Kristoffer Polaha, Brooke Burns, Corey
