Nelson) and Camille Braverman (Bonnie Bedelia) serving as the patriarch and matriarch. After forty-six years of marriage, they've managed to keep their foundation intact by burying their problems underneath the surface for the sake of their now-adult children. Adam (Peter Krause) is the first-born and the ripest apple the tree has to offer. He runs a shoe company, has a supportive wife, two children (boy and girl) and a beautiful home to share with them. He's a dog short of \"The American Dream\". Sarah (Lauren Graham), is the unstable daughter returning home at thirty-eight years of age with her rebellious daughter and sensitive son to live with Zeek and Camille. Crosby (Dax Shepard), is a happy-go-lucky bachelor living in the now, on a docked boat. He has no idea that his frivolous life is about to change tremendously. Then there is Julia (Erika Christensen). She is the bread-winning shot-calling lawyer, whose husband mans the stay-at-home-dad duties. Each family will face their own challenges, but how they propose to deal with them is what will keep them together or tear them apart.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy, 15 wins & 41 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Peter Krause, Lauren Graham, Dax Shepard","starList":[{"id":"nm0470244","name":"Peter Krause"},{"id":"nm0334179","name":"Lauren Graham"},{"id":"nm1009277","name":"Dax Shepard"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0470244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzk4NjA5NDY5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4MjgxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Krause","asCharacter":"Adam Bravermanas Adam Braverman"},{"id":"nm0334179","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc4OTQ0NTExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDkyNDQz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lauren Graham","asCharacter":"Sarah Bravermanas Sarah Braverman"},{"id":"nm1009277","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg2MzczMzgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg0MjMxNDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dax Shepard","asCharacter":"Crosby Bravermanas Crosby Braverman"},{"id":"nm0005321","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA3Mzg3Mzg5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkyMDI5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Monica Potter","asCharacter":"Kristina Bravermanas Kristina Braverman"},{"id":"nm0159776","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjQ3ODYyNTczOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1NDE2MDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Erika Christensen","asCharacter":"Julia Braverman-Grahamas Julia Braverman-Graham"},{"id":"nm0415382","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2U4ZGUxZjctNWUzZS00ZjRjLWI1ODMtM2FjNWNkNmFlYzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUxNzU2OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Jaeger","asCharacter":"Joel Grahamas Joel Graham"},{"id":"nm3548778","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxNzQ3NjMxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcyMzUzNA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Savannah Paige Rae","asCharacter":"Sydney Grahamas Sydney Graham"},{"id":"nm1370269","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3MzE2ODA5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUxNTE2NTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Max Burkholder","asCharacter":"Max Bravermanas Max Braverman"},{"id":"nm0117146","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwNTk1NTgwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcyNjY0MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joy Bryant","asCharacter":"Jasmine Trussellas Jasmine Trussell"},{"id":"nm1851028","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzAzMDZmZjItNjEwZS00N2FiLWEwMGUtODRiMGFiM2U1M2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Miles Heizer","asCharacter":"Drew Holtas Drew Holt"},{"id":"nm0926165","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2NjQxMTU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mae Whitman","asCharacter":"Amber Holtas Amber Holt"},{"id":"nm0000889","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzEyOTA4MTM5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ4NTQzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bonnie Bedelia","asCharacter":"Camille Bravermanas Camille Braverman"},{"id":"nm0005266","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI0ODQwMDU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkxNTE2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Craig T.
