In the forest, Sita was abducted by Ravana, and Rama with the help of Son of Vayu, Hanuman, gathered an army of monkeys and bears to search for her. The allies attacked Lanka, killed Ravana, and rescued Sita. After the couple's triumphant return to Ayodhya, Rama's righteous rule (Ram-raj) inaugurated a golden age for all mankind. The epic's poetic stature and marvelous story means that the story of Rama has been constantly retold by some of India's greatest writers both in Sanskrit and regional languages. It is one of the staples of various dramatic traditions, in court drama, dance-dramas, and in shadow-puppet theatres. In northern India, the annual Ram-lila or 'Rama-play' is performed at the autumn festival of Dassehra to celebrate with Rama and Sita the eventual triumph of light over darkness. Ramyug the latest visual interpretation of this ancient text, seeks to bring modern technology in a never before used manner to narrate the epic.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Vivan Bhatena, Diganth, Akshay Dogra","starList":[{"id":"nm1875257","name":"Vivan Bhatena"},{"id":"nm3261450","name":"Diganth"},{"id":"nm5157830","name":"Akshay Dogra"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1875257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODVlZGMzZmUtZTdjYi00MDRjLTkyYjktOGQ1OTQ2NTc5MmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vivan Bhatena","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm3261450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGI1MmE1NzctZjU4ZS00OTgxLTliNGYtMTllZDQ2ODFlOTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzY3MTExNTA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Diganth","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm5157830","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Akshay Dogra","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm12528900","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aishwarya Ojha","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm11012876","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sanober Pardiwalla","asCharacter":"Tadkaas Tadka"},{"id":"nm1207620","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jatin Sial","asCharacter":"Raja Janakas Raja Janak"},{"id":"nm12656042","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kabir Duhan Sing","asCharacter":""}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Action, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"MX Player, R.
