Running the station was ex-Texas Ranger and all-around eccentric Teaspoon Hunter. The role of cook, housekeeper and mother hen was filled first by Emma and later by Rachel. The riders included the future \"Buffalo Bill\" Cody and James Butler (\"Wild Bill\") Hickok, as well as Ike, a mute, Buck, a half-White/half-Kiowa scout and the Kid, a quiet Southerner. Their final member was Lou, a young woman who lived and worked with the riders disguised as a boy. They were later joined by Noah Dixon.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 2 Primetime Emmys, 6 wins & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Stephen Baldwin, Josh Brolin, Ty Miller","starList":[{"id":"nm0000286","name":"Stephen Baldwin"},{"id":"nm0000982","name":"Josh Brolin"},{"id":"nm0589470","name":"Ty Miller"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000286","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIyOTA4OTc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3ODE5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Baldwin","asCharacter":"William F.
