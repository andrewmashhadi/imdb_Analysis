Medical graduate Damien O'Donovan always gave priority to his socialist ideals and simply helping people in need. Just when he's leaving Ireland to work in a highly reputed London hospital, witnessing gross abuse of commoners changes his mind. he returns and joins the local IRA brigade, commanded by his brother Teddy, and adopts the merciless logic of civil war, while Teddy mellows by experiencing first-hand endless suffering. When IRA leaders negotiate an autonomous Free State under the British crown, Teddy defends the pragmatic best possible deal at this stage. Damien however joins the large seceding faction which holds nothing less than a socialist republic will do. The result is another civil war, bloodily opposing former Irish comrades in arms, even the brothers.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 7 wins & 24 nominations","directors":"Ken Loach","directorList":[{"id":"nm0516360","name":"Ken Loach"}],"writers":"Paul Laverty","writerList":[{"id":"nm0491956","name":"Paul Laverty"}],"stars":"Cillian Murphy, Pádraic Delaney, Liam Cunningham","starList":[{"id":"nm0614165","name":"Cillian Murphy"},{"id":"nm2073546","name":"Pádraic Delaney"},{"id":"nm0192377","name":"Liam Cunningham"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0614165","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzMjg1NzIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzg2Mjgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cillian Murphy","asCharacter":"Damienas Damien"},{"id":"nm2073546","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmRjODcyODgtOWFjMy00OGE0LWJjODUtY2I5OWE4NGZmMzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pádraic Delaney","asCharacter":"Teddyas Teddy"},{"id":"nm0192377","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyMDM0NzQ5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkyODQyNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Liam Cunningham","asCharacter":"Danas Dan"},{"id":"nm1695893","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1NjU0MjU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODg5NDI1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Orla Fitzgerald","asCharacter":"Sineadas Sinead"},{"id":"nm1800908","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mary O'Riordan","asCharacter":"Peggyas Peggy"},{"id":"nm12151758","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mary Murphy","asCharacter":"Bernadetteas Bernadette"},{"id":"nm2358153","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Laurence Barry","asCharacter":"Micheailas Micheail"},{"id":"nm2259168","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Damien Kearney","asCharacter":"Finbar -
