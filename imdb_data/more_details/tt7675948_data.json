We saw Pushpavalli's harmless infatuation for the charming Bhindi exporter Nikhil Rao turn into an obsession. From stealing Nikhil's dog to breaking her leg to get his attention, Pushpavalli set herself up to be embarrassed and yelled at by everyone around her. Hurt and distressed, her boss/childhood friend Pankaj advised her to go back home to Bhopal. Did she? No. Instead she installed CCTV at Nikhil's house. This season opens with Pushpavalli getting engaged to Vidyuth, a sweet gentle boy from Bangalore and surprisingly she appears to have moved on. She has decided to stay back in Bangalore to spend time with Vidyuth and his family while her overbearing Amma is at the Guruji's ashram. But why is she back at Pankaj's Children's Library, which is on the same street as Nikhil's Bhindi Packhouse? Why is she living again at Vasu's PG, but this time secretly? How did Nikhil and her become friends again? Why is she interested in Nikhil's Bhindi consignment to Europe? Is she helping him or is she just angry with the way she was treated and is now up to something? Or is she just not over the Bhindi exporter?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 1
