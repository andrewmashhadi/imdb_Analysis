Being unlucky in love, Kassie has decided to have a child using artificial insemination. Wally doesn't like this idea, but he isn't capable of admitting to himself, let alone to Kassie, that he's in love with her. At Kassie's artificial insemination party, Wally gets very drunk and spies the sperm donor's sample in the bathroom. Wally was way too drunk to know what he did that night, and Kassie has moved away because she doesn't feel that New York City is a place to raise a child. Now 7 years later, Kassie has moved back with her son Sebastian. While she is looking to get Roland (the sperm donor) more involved in their lives, Wally can't help but notice the many striking similarities that he and Sebastian share.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 3 nominations","directors":"Josh Gordon, Will Speck","directorList":[{"id":"nm0330347","name":"Josh Gordon"},{"id":"nm0817447","name":"Will Speck"}],"writers":"Jeffrey Eugenides, Allan Loeb","writerList":[{"id":"nm0262325","name":"Jeffrey Eugenides"},{"id":"nm1615610","name":"Allan Loeb"}],"stars":"Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Patrick Wilson","starList":[{"id":"nm0000098","name":"Jennifer Aniston"},{"id":"nm0000867","name":"Jason Bateman"},{"id":"nm0933940","name":"Patrick Wilson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000098","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjk1MjIxNjUxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2NzM4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jennifer Aniston","asCharacter":"Kassie Larsonas Kassie Larson"},{"id":"nm0000867","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwOTQ0MDUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MzY1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Bateman","asCharacter":"Wally Marsas Wally Mars"},{"id":"nm0933940","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzNzcxNzcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM1ODUzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick Wilson","asCharacter":"Rolandas Roland"},{"id":"nm0000156","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2ViNDIwNmUtZGQ5Ni00MDYxLWI5YTktNWU1NGRlYWQ1ZDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTAyMDgxODQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Goldblum","asCharacter":"Leonardas Leonard"},{"id":"nm1043006","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Victor Pagan","asCharacter":"Knit Hat Guyas Knit Hat Guy"},{"id":"nm0000496","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4Nzk1MDgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQ3MDgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Juliette Lewis","asCharacter":"Debbieas Debbie"},{"id":"nm0521974","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyNDM3MjQyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU3ODY1ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Todd Louiso","asCharacter":"Artieas Artie"},{"id":"nm2040932","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODI2OTg5MjUwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzEyNTA0ODE@._V1_Ratio1.4714_AL_.jpg","name":"Scott Elrod","asCharacter":"Declanas Declan"},{"id":"nm3135063","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNjE4OTgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyMDYxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rebecca Naomi Jones","asCharacter":"Party Guestas Party Guest"},{"id":"nm1799058","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmYxZWRlNmMtYWE3Mi00NjFmLWFlZGYtODQ0NjRlZGJlMWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk0MDMwMTQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kelli Barrett","asCharacter":"Roland's Wife Jessicaas Roland's Wife Jessica"},{"id":"nm1918843","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jeremy Mohler","asCharacter":"Party Guest 2as Party Guest 2"},{"id":"nm0842451","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMwMjg0NjQ0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA0ODkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Will Swenson","asCharacter":"Actor on Stageas Actor on Stage"},{"id":"nm0405079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjRjNTZhZTctZTNmZC00NmRjLTgxNTktMWJkYjI1NGNiMjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Edward James Hyland","asCharacter":"Man in Theateras Man in Theater"},{"id":"nm0223518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2OTU5ODY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ1MTgyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Caroline Dhavernas","asCharacter":"Paulineas Pauline"},{"id":"nm3031803","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Brian Podnos","asCharacter":"Waiteras Waiter"},{"id":"nm1740829","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYxNTA0NjgxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAzODU3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thomas Robinson","asCharacter":"Sebastianas Sebastian"},{"id":"nm2736268","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Carmen M.
