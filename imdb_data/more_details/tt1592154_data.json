What they didn't tell her was that she was being trained as a spy and assassin. Throughout her grueling training at Division, Nikita never lost her humanity, even falling in love with a civilian. When her fiancé was murdered, Nikita realized she had been betrayed and her dreams shattered by the only people she thought she could trust, so she did what no one else before her had been able to do: she escaped. Now, after three years in hiding, Nikita is seeking retribution and making it clear to her former bosses that she will stop at nothing to expose and destroy their covert operation.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys, 2 wins & 25 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Maggie Q, Shane West, Lyndsy Fonseca","starList":[{"id":"nm0702572","name":"Maggie Q"},{"id":"nm0922342","name":"Shane West"},{"id":"nm0960912","name":"Lyndsy Fonseca"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0702572","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3MTQyMDIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTMzODAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maggie Q","asCharacter":"Nikitaas Nikita"},{"id":"nm0922342","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTYzMzMxMjcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE2MDg0OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shane West","asCharacter":"Michaelas Michael"},{"id":"nm0960912","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzOTQ0NTI2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjIxMDA3MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lyndsy Fonseca","asCharacter":"Alexas Alex"},{"id":"nm0822155","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA4NzUyMTkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYxOTQwMDI@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Aaron Stanford","asCharacter":"Seymour Birkhoffas Seymour Birkhoff"},{"id":"nm0164918","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1Nzg5NDEyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODA2MzQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Melinda Clarke","asCharacter":"Amandaas Amanda"},{"id":"nm0075359","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAwMjA1OTEwOTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDkxODgxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Xander Berkeley","asCharacter":"Percyas Percy"},{"id":"nm3442405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIyMzY0NzI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ1MTgyMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lyndie Greenwood","asCharacter":"Sonyaas Sonya"},{"id":"nm2107055","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlkNzczYmQtOTZhYi00ZTg2LTg4MWEtOGM2MmNlYWM0NjllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMyMDg3NzQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dillon Casey","asCharacter":"Sean Pierceas Sean Pierce"},{"id":"nm0063800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjU5Y2MyOTMtZGZhMi00MjVjLWE1YTktZDNlNmNiOWJlNDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkyODYyMjk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Noah Bean","asCharacter":"Ryan Fletcheras Ryan Fletcher"},{"id":"nm0001701","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmQzN2E5MDctYTExYi00OTgzLTliNGYtYzdiYzgxZTIxZmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Devon Sawa","asCharacter":"Owen Elliotas Owen Elliot…"},{"id":"nm0829767","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzE3NThhZWUtZjY4Yy00OWJhLTg2YjEtYjZkNTliZGEyZmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzczOTIxODY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rob Stewart","asCharacter":"Roanas Roan"},{"id":"nm2015692","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGVmMzMxNGMtNzQ3MC00ZGU2LWFkOGUtOGM0MzlkODE2MWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tiffany Hines","asCharacter":"Jadenas Jaden"},{"id":"nm0653660","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3ODI5Mjk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE0ODgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Outerbridge","asCharacter":"Ari Tasarovas Ari Tasarov"},{"id":"nm1525948","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDEzYWMyMjEtNmQyNS00NGM1LTg5ZGEtNDQzMWFkZjE3ODBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ashton Holmes","asCharacter":"Thomas Thom"},{"id":"nm1605085","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzE5NWU2NjAtNGVmZC00MzhmLWExMzYtOTRhY2U4NGYyMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ5ODYxOTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David S.
