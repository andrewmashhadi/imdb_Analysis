Afraid to put himself out there, he considers himself a loser, as do all of his peers. One day, after having finally had enough, he decides to declare his love to the beautiful Darcy Silverman (Amanda Peet), the newspaper's travel editor and one of Gulliver's only friends, only to chicken out at the last minute and instead tell her that he'd like to try his hand at writing a column. Darcy accepts and sends him on an assignment to the Bermuda Triangle. There, Gulliver becomes shipwrecked and ends up on the island of Liliput, where he is twelve times taller than the tallest man. For the first time, Gulliver has people looking up to him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 nominations","directors":"Rob Letterman","directorList":[{"id":"nm1224299","name":"Rob Letterman"}],"writers":"Joe Stillman, Nicholas Stoller, Jonathan Swift","writerList":[{"id":"nm0830294","name":"Joe Stillman"},{"id":"nm0831557","name":"Nicholas Stoller"},{"id":"nm0842605","name":"Jonathan Swift"}],"stars":"Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Jason Segel","starList":[{"id":"nm0085312","name":"Jack Black"},{"id":"nm1289434","name":"Emily Blunt"},{"id":"nm0781981","name":"Jason Segel"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0085312","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTFiMWNlNmItMDRiYy00NzA4LWE5YjItZmViNWQ2NzhhOWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2Mjc5ODMy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Black","asCharacter":"Lemuel Gulliveras Lemuel Gulliver"},{"id":"nm1289434","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxNDY4MTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg5NzM2Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Blunt","asCharacter":"Princess Maryas Princess Mary"},{"id":"nm0781981","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwNzcxNzM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA5NzU4MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Segel","asCharacter":"Horatioas Horatio"},{"id":"nm0001605","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3Nzk0NjgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI3NDE1Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amanda Peet","asCharacter":"Darcy Silvermanas Darcy Silverman"},{"id":"nm0175262","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMzM2MTA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzIxNTM1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Connolly","asCharacter":"King Theodoreas King Theodore"},{"id":"nm1483369","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4MTQwNzk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgzMDEwMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chris O'Dowd","asCharacter":"General Edwardas General Edward"},{"id":"nm2554352","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIwMzI0NTEwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4MDkxNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"T.J.
