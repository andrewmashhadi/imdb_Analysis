Debbie and Lou assemble the rest of their team: Rose Weil, a disgraced fashion designer who is deeply in debt with the IRS; Amita, a jewelry maker and friend of Debbie's who is eager to move out of her mother's house and start her own life; Nine Ball, a computer hacker; Constance, a street hustler and pickpocket; and Tammy, a profiteer and another friend of Debbie's who has been secretly selling stolen goods out of her family's suburban home. Debbie plans to steal the Toussaint, a $150 million Cartier necklace, from the Met Gala in three-and-a-half weeks, and use Met Gala co-host Daphne Kluger, a famous actress known for her long neck, as an unwitting mule who will wear the necklace into the gala.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins & 16 nominations","directors":"Gary Ross","directorList":[{"id":"nm0002657","name":"Gary Ross"}],"writers":"Gary Ross, Olivia Milch, George Clayton Johnson","writerList":[{"id":"nm0002657","name":"Gary Ross"},{"id":"nm6035700","name":"Olivia Milch"},{"id":"nm0425138","name":"George Clayton Johnson"}],"stars":"Sandra Bullock, Cate Blanchett, Anne Hathaway","starList":[{"id":"nm0000113","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"id":"nm0000949","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"id":"nm0004266","name":"Anne Hathaway"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000113","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5NDY5NjU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sandra Bullock","asCharacter":"Debbie Oceanas Debbie Ocean"},{"id":"nm0000949","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1MDI0MDg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM3OTAzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cate Blanchett","asCharacter":"Louas Lou"},{"id":"nm0004266","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTRhNzQ3NGMtZmQ1Mi00ZTViLTk3OTgtOTk0YzE2YTgwMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5MzIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anne Hathaway","asCharacter":"Daphne Klugeras Daphne Kluger"},{"id":"nm1411676","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzQ2OTUzNDU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ2MTYyNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mindy Kaling","asCharacter":"Amitaas Amita"},{"id":"nm0001162","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGZlNGJiNWUtNWQ3NS00MjUxLWFjZDYtYWE4MjA1OTRjY2VhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzgxNzcwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Griffin Dunne","asCharacter":"Parole Board Officeras Parole Board Officer"},{"id":"nm1129963","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Deidre Goodwin","asCharacter":"Prison Guardas Prison Guard"},{"id":"nm4313350","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzBlOTE4OGEtYzRmZS00NTg3LWE1NWQtY2VlMmRhZTY3MzdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Daniella Rabbani","asCharacter":"Bergdorf Salespersonas Bergdorf Salesperson"},{"id":"nm2343704","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGEzM2IyM2UtNjBjOC00YjM4LWI5ZTYtMGZkYjE3MzllYzc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI5ODI4MzE2._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brian J.
