After having spent many years in prison, he has a very concrete picture of what he wants out of life--including a nice home, a wife, and kids. As soon as he is able to assemble the pieces of this collage, by means of his chosen profession, he intends to retire and become a model citizen. In an effort to accelerate this process, he signs on to take down a huge score for a big-time gangster. Unfortunately, Frank's obsession for his version of the American Dream allows him to overlook his natural wariness and mistrust, when making the deal for his final job. He is thus ensnared and robbed of his freedom, his independence, and, ultimately, his dream.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 6 nominations","directors":"Michael Mann","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000520","name":"Michael Mann"}],"writers":"Frank Hohimer, Michael Mann","writerList":[{"id":"nm0389821","name":"Frank Hohimer"},{"id":"nm0000520","name":"Michael Mann"}],"stars":"James Caan, Tuesday Weld, Willie Nelson","starList":[{"id":"nm0001001","name":"James Caan"},{"id":"nm0001839","name":"Tuesday Weld"},{"id":"nm0005268","name":"Willie Nelson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001001","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5NjkyNDQ3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY5NTQ0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Caan","asCharacter":"Frankas Frank"},{"id":"nm0001839","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4NjI4MzEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDUwNjI2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tuesday Weld","asCharacter":"Jessieas Jessie"},{"id":"nm0005268","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA5NTE4NDIyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzcyMTY3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Willie Nelson","asCharacter":"Oklaas Okla"},{"id":"nm0000902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NzU1ODA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTcxMjQz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Belushi","asCharacter":"Barryas Barry"},{"id":"nm0698764","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDU2MzUzMDYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ2MDkwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Prosky","asCharacter":"Leoas Leo"},{"id":"nm0797529","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmY4ZDg1MDMtOWQ4MS00OTQwLTkzZjEtOWVkZmYxYTgzYTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Signorelli","asCharacter":"Attagliaas Attaglia"},{"id":"nm0001199","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxMzE0NTU2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODQxODc1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dennis Farina","asCharacter":"Carlas Carl"},{"id":"nm0629973","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nick Nickeas","asCharacter":"Nickas Nick"},{"id":"nm0114873","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"W.R.
