Now, at long last, we know the answer: Plenty! When a toothless Frenchman finds himself the latest victim of a zombie plague, he is befriended by an overly-wholesome family that belongs more in a 1950s sitcom than the world of today. Half pet, half best friend for young Timmy, and all dead, Jean Claude proves that you don't have to have brains to eat them. Or something.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Johnny K. Wu","directorList":[{"id":"nm0943116","name":"Johnny K. Wu"}],"writers":"James V.
