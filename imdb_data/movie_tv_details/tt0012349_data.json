As she leaves the charity hospital and passes a church wedding, Edna deposits her new baby with a pleading note in a limousine and goes off to commit suicide. The limo is stolen by thieves who dump the baby by a garbage can. Charlie the Tramp finds the baby and makes a home for him. Five years later Edna has become an opera star but does charity work for slum youngsters in hopes of finding her boy. A doctor she calls discovers the note with the truth about The Kid and reports it to the authorities, who come to take him away from Charlie. Before he arrives at the Orphan Asylum, Charlie steals him back and takes him to a flophouse. The proprietor reads of a reward for the Kid and takes him to Edna. Charlie is later awakened by a kind policeman who reunites him with the Kid at Edna's mansion.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #129 | Awards, 2 wins","directors":"Charles Chaplin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"}],"writers":"Charles Chaplin","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"}],"stars":"Charles Chaplin, Edna Purviance, Jackie Coogan","starList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"},{"id":"nm0701012","name":"Edna Purviance"},{"id":"nm0001067","name":"Jackie Coogan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000122","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDcwMDc0ODAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY2OTI1MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Chaplin","asCharacter":"A Trampas A Tramp"},{"id":"nm0701012","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzMTI2MTcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY4NjYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Edna Purviance","asCharacter":"The Womanas The Woman"},{"id":"nm0001067","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0NjgwNTYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzc1ODU2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jackie Coogan","asCharacter":"The Childas The Child"},{"id":"nm0588033","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzk0MmVhOWItZjEyYy00MjM1LWEzMGUtMjE4OTA5MzE5Y2NmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Carl Miller","asCharacter":"The Manas The Man"},{"id":"nm0042317","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzVjMDQxM2ItZjJmNy00ZmZjLWI5MTQtNmQ1Yzk1ZWI1MjhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Austin","asCharacter":"Car Thiefas Car Thief"},{"id":"nm0047800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Beulah Bains","asCharacter":"Brideas Bride"},{"id":"nm0048798","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nellie Bly Baker","asCharacter":"Slum Nurseas Slum Nurse"},{"id":"nm0074788","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Henry Bergman","asCharacter":"Professor Guidoas Professor Guido"},{"id":"nm0080930","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzA0YjcxNTUtYjdjZC00MmNjLWI0MGMtZjE5Nzc1YjEyMDgzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Edward Biby","asCharacter":"Orphan Asylum Driveras Orphan Asylum Driver"},{"id":"nm0088471","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzcxYWRjN2UtNTA1OC00ZDExLTk5ZmItNjI3YmUyNWQ2MmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"B.F.
