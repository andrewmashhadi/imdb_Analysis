Then, one day, he sees her. Tall, with long chestnut hair, a buttery complexion, and big, dark eyes; an enigmatically beautiful girl standing in front of the school's gate, indolently observing people passing by. To get noticed by the distant girl, Raphina, Conor enlists the help of a group of teenage dreamers to form a band and, surprisingly, with every lyric he writes, the gap narrows; and with every song he plays, her heart brims over with affection. Now, before a sea of opportunities, what does the future hold for a brave love like this?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 16 wins & 46 nominations","directors":"John Carney","directorList":[{"id":"nm0138809","name":"John Carney"}],"writers":"Simon Carmody, John Carney","writerList":[{"id":"nm8823854","name":"Simon Carmody"},{"id":"nm0138809","name":"John Carney"}],"stars":"Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy","starList":[{"id":"nm6916321","name":"Ferdia Walsh-Peelo"},{"id":"nm0318821","name":"Aidan Gillen"},{"id":"nm0448204","name":"Maria Doyle Kennedy"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm6916321","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjJiNWNmMzQtMDIxZS00MjEzLTlmZTAtZDk5ZDZlZjBhZjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTY5NzYwODM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ferdia Walsh-Peelo","asCharacter":"Conoras Conor"},{"id":"nm0318821","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMwNzE4MzMxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYwMTEyMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aidan Gillen","asCharacter":"Robertas Robert"},{"id":"nm0448204","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4OTk5ODgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTExNzI1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maria Doyle Kennedy","asCharacter":"Pennyas Penny"},{"id":"nm2930503","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2FiZWVhOGUtM2QxNy00NzcwLTg2NGQtYjE0ZDMwN2M4MjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTg1MjUxMjA@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Reynor","asCharacter":"Brendanas Brendan"},{"id":"nm5801651","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzc0ZDk3YjMtMjI4My00ZmM5LWJhMGEtZWZkYjUyYWYzMTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjAyMzQxNzY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kelly Thornton","asCharacter":"Annas Ann"},{"id":"nm2498053","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc4NDdiNWItMGRmYi00YzY5LTlmODQtZGM1NmM4Y2RmZmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjEwMjYzNDA@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ian Kenny","asCharacter":"Barryas Barry"},{"id":"nm7860900","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzMyODMwZjctYWEwZi00MjI3LWFkNDctN2Q5MzQwNDAzZjYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg4MDUxMzk@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ben Carolan","asCharacter":"Darrenas Darren"},{"id":"nm7860901","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Percy Chamburuka","asCharacter":"Ngigas Ngig"},{"id":"nm7603308","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzQzYTVhNDUtNGQ4Ni00ZDVhLTkwZWEtMDk1M2JlZjMxNWU0L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNjA2NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark McKenna","asCharacter":"Eamonas Eamon"},{"id":"nm0943614","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2VlNmIyYTAtMjI2OS00NzY1LWEyOTctOTZmMjI2Yzk5YjZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTY1MzEzMzc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Wycherley","asCharacter":"Brother Baxteras Brother Baxter"},{"id":"nm0449048","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Des Keogh","asCharacter":"Brother Barnabasas Brother Barnabas"},{"id":"nm3912874","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kian Murphy","asCharacter":"Mick Mahonas Mick Mahon"},{"id":"nm4860644","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dolores Mullally","asCharacter":"Dinner Ladyas Dinner Lady"},{"id":"nm2377903","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4ZWI3ZDktNzBiYS00MzdiLTk2MDEtOWNlOTY0ZDg3NDBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY2MTA2OTg@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Lucy Boynton","asCharacter":"Raphinaas Raphina"},{"id":"nm0687692","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODQyNzgzODk3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYzOTIwMjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marcella Plunkett","asCharacter":"Eamon's Mumas Eamon's Mum"},{"id":"nm8302510","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Vera Nwabuwe","asCharacter":"Ngig's Mumas Ngig's Mum"},{"id":"nm7874348","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Conor Hamilton","asCharacter":"Larryas Larry"},{"id":"nm4625381","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Karl Rice","asCharacter":"Garryas Garry"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Music","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Music","value":"Music"}],"companies":"Cosmo Films, Distressed Films, FilmNation Entertainment","companyList":[{"id":"co0487903","name":"Cosmo Films"},{"id":"co0470081","name":"Distressed Films"},{"id":"co0251858","name":"FilmNation Entertainment"}],"countries":"Ireland, UK","countryList":[{"key":"Ireland","value":"Ireland"},{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English, French, Latin","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"Latin","value":"Latin"}],"contentRating":"PG-13","imDbRating":"7.9","imDbRatingVotes":"92278","metacriticRating":"79","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"$63,573","grossUSA":"$3,237,118","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$13,624,522"},"tagline":"Boy meets girl.
