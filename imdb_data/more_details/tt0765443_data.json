In London, pregnant Russian teenager Tatiana arrives bleeding to a hospital, and the doctors save her baby only. Russian-descendant midwife Anna Khitrova finds Tatiana's diary written in Russian language in her belongings and, deciding to find her family and bring them the baby, she brings the diary home and asks her uncle Stepan to translate the document. Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon inside the diary and visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill had raped Tatiana when she was 14 and forced her to work as a prostitute in their brothel. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia \"Vory v Zakone\", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family, and the baby.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 28 wins & 74 nominations total","directors":"David Cronenberg","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000343","name":"David Cronenberg"}],"writers":"Steven Knight","writerList":[{"id":"nm1140275","name":"Steven Knight"}],"stars":"Naomi Watts, Viggo Mortensen, Armin Mueller-Stahl","starList":[{"id":"nm0915208","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"id":"nm0001557","name":"Viggo Mortensen"},{"id":"nm0000090","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0915208","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIzMjY1NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3MDYwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Naomi Watts","asCharacter":"Annaas Anna"},{"id":"nm0001557","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQzOTg4NzA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwNjkxMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Viggo Mortensen","asCharacter":"Nikolaias Nikolai"},{"id":"nm0000090","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MTI3NTk0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE3MDAxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl","asCharacter":"Semyonas Semyon"},{"id":"nm1086981","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5Mjc5NzQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ3MzQxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Josef Altin","asCharacter":"Ekremas Ekrem"},{"id":"nm0590875","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mina E.
