Three Shadow Magi manage to track them down nonetheless and a battle ensues to protect Evu. The wily senior proves more than capable of protecting herself as she pulverizes the villains with her own elephantine Dream Creature. We learn that Evu wanted the kids to join her in D'Resh because that's where they're all getting picked up to travel to the secret location where the Leaders of the various Moonlands realms meet. Flying to Arderial, our heroes enter a hidden citadel where they meet the Leaders. With the situation in the Moonlands becoming dire, the Council is in a heated argument as to whether or not to activate The Gear. It's a Doomsday device; the most powerful relic in all the Moonlands. Once activated, the Gear will jettison the Core from the center of the Moonlands moon, eliminating Agram at a threat - but in the process, it will destroy half the Moonlands' realms. A vote is held on the matter. Tony, Edyn and Strag make an impassioned plea to the Council. If they can prove that they're the Final Dreamers - who legend says will defeat Agram - then the Gear isn't required and half the Moonlands can be spared. The vote lands in favor of testing the kids to see if they're the Final Dreamer. In the middle of the test, the Citadel shakes. Shadow Magi Orwin has located the hidden citadel and is attacking it. Not only is this the perfect opportunity for him to destroy all the Moonlands Leaders, but the Final Dreamers as well. The kids stop their test and proceed to battle Orwin. As the battle sways in favor of the Shadow Magi, the Council leans towards activating The Gear. Evu buys the kids more time. Tony, Edyn and Strag eventually capture Orwin, defeat his Shadow Magi force, and prevent the use of the Gear. Proof that they're the real Final Dreamers comes when the kids' join their powers with those of the Leader...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Dwayne Hill, Helen King, Julie Lemieux","starList":[{"id":"nm0384214","name":"Dwayne Hill"},{"id":"nm1345171","name":"Helen King"},{"id":"nm0501306","name":"Julie Lemieux"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0384214","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MzM2MDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg4Mzc2OTE@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Dwayne Hill","asCharacter":"Variousas Various"},{"id":"nm1345171","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjI1ZDg5ZGEtYTcyOS00MDlmLTkxNDctMmIwY2U1YzJkYzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY0MzkyOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.1714_AL_.jpg","name":"Helen King","asCharacter":"Shimmeras Shimmer"},{"id":"nm0501306","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDhiYWM4OGYtMGI0Mi00Mzg0LTgyMTEtZGZiZDY0ZDYyYzc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.1286_AL_.jpg","name":"Julie Lemieux","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0532900","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1OTUxMzY4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIyNDE4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Martha MacIsaac","asCharacter":"Edynas Edyn"},{"id":"nm2060708","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzk4NjQ2MmMtNzBmMi00NTY4LTg0YjYtMTY5NWM3NGFlOWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM5ODUxNDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rick Miller","asCharacter":"Orwinas Orwin…"},{"id":"nm0678107","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwMTg4MzAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc1Nzk1OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dan Petronijevic","asCharacter":"Stagas Stag"},{"id":"nm0809174","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDM1ZTlmYzQtYTk4Ny00OTRmLWFmMzQtNzc2MzZjYWRlYzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.4571_AL_.jpg","name":"Lyon Smith","asCharacter":"Tony Jonesas Tony Jones"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":"TV-Y7-FV","imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt1001475","seriesTitle":"Magi-Nation","seriesFullTitle":"Magi-Nation (TV Series 2007– )","seriesYear":"2007","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"18","previousEpisodeId":"tt1292358","nextEpisodeId":"tt1292353"},"errorMessage":null}
