What they don't know is that the house was the site of a horrific mass murder a year before. They decide to keep the house and attempt to keep the horror in the past, but are now haunted by a murderous presence. This is until, George starts to behave weirdly and their daughter, Chelsea starts to see people. What follows is 28 days of sheer, unbridled terror for the family with demonic visions of the dead. Based on the true story of George and Kathy Lutz, The Amityville Horror remains one of the most horrifying haunted house stories ever told - because it actually happened.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 4 nominations","directors":"Andrew Douglas","directorList":[{"id":"nm1497918","name":"Andrew Douglas"}],"writers":"Scott
