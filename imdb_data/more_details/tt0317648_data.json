Hopkins, who has an Indian mother, was wounded and traumatized for life as US Cavalry scout at the Wounded Knee Massacre and joint Buffalo Bill's world travelling (Ringling Circus) Wild West show as horse stuntman as well as reputed horse racer. An Arabian sheikh comes dare him to defend the show billing as the world's greatest endurance rider, by entering -as first Westerner- the millennial great 'ocean of fire' race across the unforgiving Arab deserts, which always eliminates most riders, often fatally. Hopkins enters with the first-ever non-thoroughbred, his trusted mustang Hidalgo. As if learning the harsh country in the act weren't hard enough, he must contend with contempt for infidels and impure horses, as well as competitors stopping at nothing, including the Enlish lady davenport who employs one, having wagered against the obvious favorite, the champions from the stable of Sheikh Riyadh, whose tomcat daughter sides with Hopkins, which proves both helpful and as a mortal a danger as a sand storm.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations","directors":"Joe Johnston","directorList":[{"id":"nm0002653","name":"Joe Johnston"}],"writers":"John Fusco","writerList":[{"id":"nm0299301","name":"John Fusco"}],"stars":"Viggo Mortensen, Omar Sharif, Zuleikha Robinson","starList":[{"id":"nm0001557","name":"Viggo Mortensen"},{"id":"nm0001725","name":"Omar Sharif"},{"id":"nm0733196","name":"Zuleikha Robinson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001557","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQzOTg4NzA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwNjkxMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Viggo Mortensen","asCharacter":"Frank Hopkinsas Frank Hopkins"},{"id":"nm0001725","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0ODg3MjM0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTM2MDU0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Omar Sharif","asCharacter":"Sheikh Riyadhas Sheikh Riyadh"},{"id":"nm0733196","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAwMTU1NzExNjleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDI1NjY3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Zuleikha Robinson","asCharacter":"Jaziraas Jazira"},{"id":"nm0518321","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWVjYTQxOTQtN2M1Ny00YzJlLWI1MDItZDY5ZDQ3NWQ5ODM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODg2NjI0NDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Louise Lombard","asCharacter":"Lady Anne Davenportas Lady Anne Davenport"},{"id":"nm0018956","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2Y4ZWM1MmItZjJlOC00ZmUxLWE4ZjMtMTUyMzc1MjcwY2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ4NjQwNTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Alexi-Malle","asCharacter":"Azizas Aziz"},{"id":"nm0846548","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4OTc0NjkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwOTgyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sa√Ød Taghmaoui","asCharacter":"Prince Bin Al Reehas Prince Bin Al Reeh"},{"id":"nm0141324","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzY1OTU5NDYtNDBjZC00NGUzLThmZWQtZDZjYTMzZDhkYzNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA5MjUwODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Silas Carson","asCharacter":"Katibas Katib"},{"id":"nm0623319","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjExMjk3OTgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1NDcwNw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Harsh Nayyar","asCharacter":"Yusefas Yusef"},{"id":"nm0799777","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzg2NTI5NzQ1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NDEwMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"J.K.
