Examples might include a professional baseball player who had betrayed the trust of his team; a college student who was mourning the loss of his girlfriend in a car accident; a recovering alcoholic struggling with the temptation to jump off the wagon; and a couple contemplating divorce. In the early years, the program featured the Fisher family, a \"typical family\" from Middleburg in an unnamed Midwestern state; in later years, the programs featured new characters and settings.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy, 7 wins & 2 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Nelson
