His outstanding creations--such as the Dutch Embassy in Berlin, the Seattle Library and the Casa da Musica concert hall in Porto--are working examples of the Dutchman's visionary theories about architecture and urban society. But Koolhaas' work is as much about ideas as it is about constructing buildings; he is equally celebrated as a writer and social commentator. For Koolhaas, what is essential is not to create individual masterpieces, but to provoke and excite through the wide range of his activities. REM KOOLHAAS: A KIND OF ARCHITECT is an engaging portrait of a visionary man that takes us to the heart of his ideas. Directors Markus Heidingsfelder and Min Tesch have made a visually inventive, thought-provoking portrait of the architect, prompting Rem Koolhaas to state, \"It's the only film about me that I have liked.\"","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Markus Heidingsfelder, Min Tesch","directorList":[{"id":"nm3124215","name":"Markus Heidingsfelder"},{"id":"nm2207515","name":"Min Tesch"}],"writers":"Markus Heidingsfelder","writerList":[{"id":"nm3124215","name":"Markus Heidingsfelder"}],"stars":"Dirk Baecker, Cecil Balmond, Rene Daalder","starList":[{"id":"nm2446223","name":"Dirk Baecker"},{"id":"nm4287086","name":"Cecil Balmond"},{"id":"nm0196350","name":"Rene Daalder"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2446223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dirk Baecker","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm4287086","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cecil Balmond","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0196350","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rene Daalder","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0220273","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Dercon","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0465549","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rem Koolhaas","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1776418","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Thomas Krens","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm6660639","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bruno Latour","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10752735","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Holger Liebs","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10752734","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bart Lootsma","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1615630","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Richard Meier","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10752733","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joshua Prince-Ramos","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10752736","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ole Scheeren","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10752737","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Clemens Weisshaar","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"Germany","countryList":[{"key":"Germany","value":"Germany"}],"languages":"Mandarin, German, English","languageList":[{"key":"Mandarin","value":"Mandarin"},{"key":"German","value":"German"},{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"Not Rated","imDbRating":"6.6","imDbRatingVotes":"94","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"architect,architecture,arthouse","keywordList":["architect","architecture","arthouse"],"similars":[{"id":"tt1233611","title":"Visual Acoustics","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MjAyMzAyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM2OTYyMg@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.4"}],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
