Kamau Bell hosts this CNN original documentary series in which he travels to the far corners of America to explore race-based subcultures. Using humor to soften his experiences, Bell willingly subjects himself to awkward situations -- like attending a cross-burning, hate-mongering Ku Klux Klan session -- to demonstrate \"the many diverse and colorful definitions of America,\" CNN says. Bell also visits a gated retirement community, experiences inner-city policing, spends time with spring break revelers, speaks to prison inmates, and travels to the Last Frontier.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 5 Primetime Emmys, 5 wins & 14 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"W.
