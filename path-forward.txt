Two Main Sections

SECTION (1) 

- Rating prediction grouped by time intervals
- random forests (see display options in randomForest package feature importance), nnet, lm's, etc. 
  could use tidy models to optimize/tune the random subset size (mtry) 
- exploratory analysis
- split genres and other strings for true or false columns before use
- compare different models predictive values with MSE (K-fold CV) and prediction accuracy
- ...


SECTION (2) 

- Clustering: description -> labels
- tf and common words for clusters
- tf_idf vs tf/stop words
- clustering within genres
- clustering within year intervals
- we need to provide examples and something to talk about (mentioned from Prof Zes)
- ...



NICE ADDITIONS 
- putting scraped movie images together in a mosaic similar to prof zes examples
