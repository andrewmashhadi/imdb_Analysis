It's in a perfect location and has been newly renovated. The one odd thing is that the previous tenant left suddenly and mysteriously. Soon the couple finds that, whatever the previous tenant's reasons for making a hasty exit, they have a frightening reason of their own. The apartment seems to be haunted. They see the ghost of a panicking teenage boy with blood dripping down his face. Worse, the figure of a gunman appears and flicks a lit cigarette at Bill, burning him. The couple calls in Shannon Stidman from the Washington Ghost Society. Stidman, with the assistance of the psychic Lois Lee, visits the apartment and finds something more horrifying than anything she has seen before.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Stuart Taylor","directorList":[{"id":"nm0853219","name":"Stuart Taylor"}],"writers":"Joe Amodio","writerList":[{"id":"nm1333022","name":"Joe Amodio"}],"stars":"Anthony D.
