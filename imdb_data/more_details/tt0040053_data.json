At least once, he showed a film, the only known film of Anna Pavlova (doing her Swan Dance). The Muppets' first TV appearance was on Ed Sullivan. Stiff and expressionless, with a peculiar voice and a talent for mispronunciation, Sullivan was at least as recognizable as Cronkite to early 60's viewers.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy, 6 wins & 7 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Ed Sullivan, Johnny Wayne, Frank Shuster","starList":[{"id":"nm0838047","name":"Ed Sullivan"},{"id":"nm0915590","name":"Johnny Wayne"},{"id":"nm0795971","name":"Frank Shuster"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0838047","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1NDA0NTg3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQyNDQ2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed Sullivan","asCharacter":"Self -
