One night, he nearly runs over a dog with his car. The dog yells \"bonehead\" and disappears. From then on, his childhood ability is back: To communicate with animals. Unfortunately, the word of Dolittle's ability is spreading quickly. Soon, many animals from rat to horse flock to his place to get medical advice. But his colleagues suspect he's going mad, and as the clinic Dolittle used to work for is about to being taken over for a huge amount of money, many decisions have to be made. Believe him? Put him into a mental institution? Sell the clinic? But also his family is close to breaking apart. Until a circus tiger falls seriously ill.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 4 wins & 10 nominations","directors":"Betty Thomas","directorList":[{"id":"nm0858525","name":"Betty Thomas"}],"writers":"Hugh Lofting, Nat Mauldin, Larry Levin","writerList":[{"id":"nm0517452","name":"Hugh Lofting"},{"id":"nm0560894","name":"Nat Mauldin"},{"id":"nm0505648","name":"Larry Levin"}],"stars":"Eddie Murphy, Peter Boyle, Ossie Davis","starList":[{"id":"nm0000552","name":"Eddie Murphy"},{"id":"nm0001967","name":"Peter Boyle"},{"id":"nm0001115","name":"Ossie Davis"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000552","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0NDQzODAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzUzNTk3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eddie Murphy","asCharacter":"Dr. John Dolittleas Dr. John Dolittle"},{"id":"nm0001967","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0ODc5NTE4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY3MTI0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Boyle","asCharacter":"Callowayas Calloway"},{"id":"nm0001115","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcxNTA4NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODYzMDI0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ossie Davis","asCharacter":"Archer Dolittleas Archer Dolittle"},{"id":"nm0001624","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzkzNDgzNjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzODA0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Oliver Platt","asCharacter":"Dr. Mark Welleras Dr. Mark Weller"},{"id":"nm0771493","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0MDE5MzIwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjgzMDI0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Schiff","asCharacter":"Dr. Gene 'Geno' Reissas Dr. Gene 'Geno' Reiss"},{"id":"nm0933723","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyOTc5NDI3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE0NDQ0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kristen Wilson","asCharacter":"Lisa Dolittleas Lisa Dolittle"},{"id":"nm0001787","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzQxMzA3NzQzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxMDc3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeffrey Tambor","asCharacter":"Dr. Fishas Dr. Fish"},{"id":"nm0695497","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTE3ODczOWEtZWIxMS00NGQxLTgxODgtYzg2YmI5ZDFkMTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwOTk5Mzk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kyla Pratt","asCharacter":"Maya Dolittleas Maya Dolittle"},{"id":"nm0712368","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU5MzM4NTA0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyOTgyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Raven-Symon√©","asCharacter":"Charisse Dolittleas Charisse Dolittle"},{"id":"nm0318318","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDEzMjM4MTg1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI1NjEwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Steven Gilborn","asCharacter":"Dr. Sam Litvackas Dr. Sam Litvack"},{"id":"nm0217529","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxMDIxNjgzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAzMTYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Erik Dellums","asCharacter":"Jeremyas Jeremy"},{"id":"nm0160590","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDEzMDk2YTgtOTA3MC00ODg2LWFiOTYtOTg1MjMxZWU1NjU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDEwNDk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"June Christopher","asCharacter":"Dianeas Diane"},{"id":"nm0291386","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cherie Franklin","asCharacter":"Mrs. Parkusas Mrs. Parkus"},{"id":"nm0010486","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlmZmZiZTctNmUzMS00ZDYzLWE1OTMtNDA2ZTBlMDBkMWQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark Adair-Rios","asCharacter":"Internas Intern"},{"id":"nm0129883","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM3NDAwMjg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY0MDQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Calfa","asCharacter":"Patient at Hammersmithas Patient at Hammersmith"},{"id":"nm0877390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2YwM2QyODItZDYyYy00ZTgxLTg1ZGYtMWUzMjExYmM3MWE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Arnold F.
