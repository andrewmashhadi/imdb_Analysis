She's twenty-five, personal assistant to an L.A. family that's off on vacation. Her boss's brother comes in from New York City, fresh from a stay at an asylum, to take care of the house. He's Roger, a forty-year-old carpenter, gone from L.A. for fifteen years. He arrives, doesn't drive, and needs Florence's help, especially with the family's dog. He's also connecting with former band-mates - two men and one woman with whom he has a history. He over-analyzes, has a short fuse, and doesn't laugh at himself easily. As he navigates past and present, he's his own saboteur. And what of Florence? is Roger one more responsibility for her or something else?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 15 nominations","directors":"Noah Baumbach","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000876","name":"Noah Baumbach"}],"writers":"Jennifer Jason Leigh, Noah Baumbach","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000492","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"},{"id":"nm0000876","name":"Noah Baumbach"}],"stars":"Ben Stiller, Greta Gerwig, Jennifer Jason Leigh","starList":[{"id":"nm0001774","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"id":"nm1950086","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"id":"nm0000492","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001774","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjc4NDc3NDkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAyNTQwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ben Stiller","asCharacter":"Roger Greenbergas Roger Greenberg"},{"id":"nm1950086","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE5MTIxMTMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMxMDYxOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Greta Gerwig","asCharacter":"Florence Marras Florence Marr"},{"id":"nm0000492","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1MzU2NTg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjcyNjY0MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh","asCharacter":"Beth -
