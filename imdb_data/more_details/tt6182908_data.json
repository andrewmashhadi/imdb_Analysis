Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, believing this allows the sun to rise. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he loves, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a \"smallfoot\" (human), whom the yetis have taken for legend. Migo runs back to tell the villagers what he saw, but has no proof. The Stonekeeper banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem who bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society (S.E.S.), which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo to be lowered below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land..","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 15 nominations","directors":"Karey Kirkpatrick, Jason Reisig","directorList":[{"id":"nm0456732","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"},{"id":"nm1134222","name":"Jason Reisig"}],"writers":"Karey Kirkpatrick, Clare Sera, John Requa","writerList":[{"id":"nm0456732","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"},{"id":"nm0784771","name":"Clare Sera"},{"id":"nm0720135","name":"John Requa"}],"stars":"Channing Tatum, James Corden, Zendaya","starList":[{"id":"nm1475594","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"id":"nm0179479","name":"James Corden"},{"id":"nm3918035","name":"Zendaya"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1475594","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyOTc2NTEwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxMjMxNjE@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Channing Tatum","asCharacter":"Migoas Migo"},{"id":"nm0179479","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxMzYwYTctMGRlMC00MjRmLTk3YTUtZTFmNjZlMDVjYTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Corden","asCharacter":"Percyas Percy"},{"id":"nm3918035","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxZTk4NDAtYjI3Mi00OTk3LTg0NDEtNWFlNzE5NDM5MWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTI3MjYwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Zendaya","asCharacter":"Meecheeas Meechee"},{"id":"nm0996669","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzg4MTk5NDM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM5OTQzMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Common","asCharacter":"Stonekeeperas Stonekeeper"},{"id":"nm1429908","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzE2NzEwMTUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQ4NTQz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"LeBron James","asCharacter":"Gwangias Gwangi"},{"id":"nm0000362","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE5MjM5MzM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTEzOTY0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Danny DeVito","asCharacter":"Dorgleas Dorgle"},{"id":"nm1752221","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzY5NDU2MDc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE3Mzg5NjE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gina Rodriguez","asCharacter":"Kolkaas Kolka"},{"id":"nm2780578","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzNjIwNzQ1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUwODk2NDM@._V1_Ratio1.4714_AL_.jpg","name":"Yara Shahidi","asCharacter":"Brendaas Brenda"},{"id":"nm1596025","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlhMDFhZDUtNzY3ZS00ZWIxLTkyMWYtNjMzMzI5MjZhNWRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc0NDYzODQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ely Henry","asCharacter":"Fleemas Fleem"},{"id":"nm5555161","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzQwOWQ0ODUtNjJlNC00OTE4LThjNjAtZDIzZWM0ZGY2ZWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA4NzYyNTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jimmy Tatro","asCharacter":"Thorpas Thorp"},{"id":"nm0005004","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyMzI5MDE5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODkxODE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patricia Heaton","asCharacter":"Mama Bearas Mama Bear"},{"id":"nm1551598","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTYxMTE5MjY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3Mzg3MDI@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Justin Roiland","asCharacter":"Garryas Garry"},{"id":"nm4425051","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2Y2MmIzOGEtNTgyYi00OWUyLTljNzEtYmFlOWU2MzFkZTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjYyNDg5NzY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Quaid","asCharacter":"Pilotas Pilot"},{"id":"nm1807222","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNjg5NDg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM0MTcyMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarah Baker","asCharacter":"Soozie's Momas Soozie's Mom"},{"id":"nm0390223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzYwZTgwODItMTAwNi00MjkzLWIwZTktMWY5YTJmMTIyNjVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODYxOTU0Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.4429_AL_.jpg","name":"Kelly Holden Bashar","asCharacter":"Additional Voicesas Additional Voices"},{"id":"nm0262201","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Ettinger","asCharacter":"Additional Voicesas Additional Voices"},{"id":"nm1745277","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyODAyOTcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc2MTkwMTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Kite","asCharacter":"Additional Voicesas Additional Voices"},{"id":"nm0542307","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGY4ZGI3ZTItMmQ0ZS00MzdiLWJkMGEtZjM5ZmFkMDkyM2I3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUwOTg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Mangum","asCharacter":"Additional Voicesas Additional Voices"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Adventure, Comedy","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"}],"companies":"Warner Animation Group, Warner Bros.
