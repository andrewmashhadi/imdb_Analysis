Along with several other angels, they currently wander around West Berlin, generally on their own, observing and preserving life, sometimes trying to provide comfort to the troubled, although those efforts are not always successful. Among those they are currently observing are: the cast and crew of a movie - a detective story set in WWII Nazi Germany - which include a sensitive and perceptive Peter Falk; an elderly man named Homer looking for eternal peace; and the troupe of a financially failing circus, which has closed early for the season because of those financial problems. One day, Damiel tells Cassiel that he wants to become human, to feel not only the sensory aspects of physical beings, but also emotional aspects. He embarks on this thought with the full realization that there is no turning back if he decides to do so. His thoughts are largely because he has fallen in love with Marion, the trapeze artist with the circus. If he does decide to become a human, there is no guarantee that as a human that he will be able to locate Marion or that she will return his affection. His angels, however, may be looking out for him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 19 wins & 16 nominations total","directors":"Wim Wenders","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000694","name":"Wim Wenders"}],"writers":"Wim Wenders, Peter Handke, Richard Reitinger","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000694","name":"Wim Wenders"},{"id":"nm0359563","name":"Peter Handke"},{"id":"nm0718637","name":"Richard Reitinger"}],"stars":"Bruno Ganz, Solveig Dommartin, Otto Sander","starList":[{"id":"nm0004486","name":"Bruno Ganz"},{"id":"nm0231652","name":"Solveig Dommartin"},{"id":"nm0761420","name":"Otto Sander"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0004486","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjkzYjU2NzAtMmEyZC00YTg2LWJmYTMtOGM1YTMwOTYwZTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bruno Ganz","asCharacter":"Damielas Damiel"},{"id":"nm0231652","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMxNDg1MDc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTcyMTE3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Solveig Dommartin","asCharacter":"Marionas Marion"},{"id":"nm0761420","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIxNjUxNTQ3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0MjMyMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Otto Sander","asCharacter":"Cassielas Cassiel"},{"id":"nm0092290","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWM2NzNmZTctYjJkNi00YjBjLWIyMjgtNjMyMWYxNDZlZmI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3000_AL_.jpg","name":"Curt Bois","asCharacter":"Homeras Homer"},{"id":"nm0000393","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4ODUwNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA1NTM0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Falk","asCharacter":"Der Filmstaras Der Filmstar"},{"id":"nm0830105","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hans Martin Stier","asCharacter":"In weiteren Rollen -
