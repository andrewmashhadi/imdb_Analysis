Miles is the oenophile and does his best to teach Jack a bit about the art of appreciating great wine. All Jack cares about is drinking and carousing, something he accomplishes when he meets the attractive Stephanie at one of the vineyards. Miles is something of a sad sack, a high school English teacher who is a failed writer at heart. He has yet to get over the fact that his wife has divorced him and that she has remarried and he now faces that nerve racking wait for word from a prospective publisher. Miles has an opportunity to start anew when he meets Stephanie's friend Maya but when he let's slip that Jack is about to be married any hope of a relationship seems to be lost.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 122 wins & 91 nominations total","directors":"Alexander Payne","directorList":[{"id":"nm0668247","name":"Alexander Payne"}],"writers":"Rex Pickett, Alexander Payne, Jim Taylor","writerList":[{"id":"nm0681914","name":"Rex Pickett"},{"id":"nm0668247","name":"Alexander Payne"},{"id":"nm0852591","name":"Jim Taylor"}],"stars":"Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen","starList":[{"id":"nm0316079","name":"Paul Giamatti"},{"id":"nm0002006","name":"Thomas Haden Church"},{"id":"nm0000515","name":"Virginia Madsen"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0316079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc0MDAzMTU4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA0NzcwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Paul Giamatti","asCharacter":"Milesas Miles"},{"id":"nm0002006","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjkxNDQ1MzIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA1MTA4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Thomas Haden Church","asCharacter":"Jackas Jack"},{"id":"nm0000515","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjUyMDcxNTU3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAwNjQzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Virginia Madsen","asCharacter":"Mayaas Maya"},{"id":"nm0644897","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyNzYyNDE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkxMDQ2NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Sandra Oh","asCharacter":"Stephanieas Stephanie"},{"id":"nm0121793","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA2MzgxMzcyMTJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA4MzIxMTMx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Marylouise Burke","asCharacter":"Miles's Motheras Miles's Mother"},{"id":"nm0372961","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyNDA3MzUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1NTQ0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jessica Hecht","asCharacter":"Victoriaas Victoria"},{"id":"nm1671191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1NTY3OTM5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxOTIyNDE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.webp","name":"Missy Doty","asCharacter":"Cammias Cammi"},{"id":"nm0301370","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTYyOTM1Njc1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQwMzgyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"M.C.
