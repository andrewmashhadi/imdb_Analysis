They are there to follow a destiny given to them by the members of their dying race, a race that they are someday destined to save. This is the background behind the WB series \"Roswell\". Max Evans, Isabel Evans and Michael Guerin are teenage humans with extraordinary gifts - gifts that are \"not-of-this-earth\". They are human/alien hybrids, sent here to complete their destiny. Their counterparts have already perished in a war of attrition, thus one day, they will return to their home planet and save their race. Before a fateful day in 1999, the teens hid their gifts. The event that forever changed their lives was when Max healed Liz Parker (a classmate) after she was fatally shot in the stomach in a dispute between two customers at the restaurant where she waitresses. A close relationship then develops between Max and Liz. Central to the first season were the relationships between the hybrids and their human companions. That focus has shifted during the drama's second season. \"Roswell\" is now distinctly a science-fiction show built on the relationships between humans and aliens.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 24 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Shiri Appleby, Jason Behr, Katherine Heigl","starList":[{"id":"nm0032375","name":"Shiri Appleby"},{"id":"nm0004736","name":"Jason Behr"},{"id":"nm0001337","name":"Katherine Heigl"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0032375","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmE5NWQ0MzctYjAxOC00OTU3LThjNTMtMGJiMzc1OTAwMzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1MjYyNTA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shiri Appleby","asCharacter":"Liz Parkeras Liz Parker"},{"id":"nm0004736","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyNDY5OTA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU3NjEyNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Behr","asCharacter":"Max Evansas Max Evans"},{"id":"nm0001337","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTM0NDEwMjA1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQxMDI3Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Katherine Heigl","asCharacter":"Isabel Evansas Isabel Evans"},{"id":"nm0004868","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0OTEzMTY4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzUwODEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Majandra Delfino","asCharacter":"Maria DeLucaas Maria DeLuca"},{"id":"nm0270451","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzAxOTI3NzY0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY0MjcwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brendan Fehr","asCharacter":"Michael Guerinas Michael Guerin"},{"id":"nm0917060","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzY1OTYyNjgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQxMzM3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nick Wechsler","asCharacter":"Kyle Valentias Kyle Valenti"},{"id":"nm0006669","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA1NjU3NDg1MTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDI4OTcxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Sadler","asCharacter":"Jim Valentias Jim Valenti"},{"id":"nm0004988","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5OTcxNjIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI0NjMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Colin Hanks","asCharacter":"Alex Whitmanas Alex Whitman"},{"id":"nm0211087","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyNmNiZTUtMzA4NS00OWZmLThiNzEtNGY1MDYyOTNhY2E3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1MjYyNTA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emilie de Ravin","asCharacter":"Tess Hardingas Tess Harding"},{"id":"nm0870729","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzI5ODIxMjAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NDM5NTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Ellen Trainor","asCharacter":"Diane Evansas Diane Evans"},{"id":"nm0735226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1MTM5Nzk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjgwOTMwNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Rodriguez","asCharacter":"Jesse Ramirezas Jesse Ramirez"},{"id":"nm0230335","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODUyNzM1NzY0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk5ODQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Doe","asCharacter":"Jeff Parkeras Jeff Parker"},{"id":"nm0113595","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxMjE4NTgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc5ODg2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Garrett M.
