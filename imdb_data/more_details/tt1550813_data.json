Two people are faced with this question as they both encounter terrible heartaches, and stumble upon each other, through a simple, yet life-changing action. Patty (Kaye Abad) and Lester (Diether Ocampo) may be worlds apart, and it may be literally so, as Lester is a seaman. However, their worlds intertwine through a chance phone call one night, and they discover that they both have something in common: they're both hurting from recent heartaches!
