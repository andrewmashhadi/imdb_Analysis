Once there, he meets, falls in love with Pinky, who introduces him to her extended family, and then tells him that she is pregnant. He decides to marry her but incurs the wrath of her family, especially her father, Retired Subedar Harmeet Singh. Both then re-locate to live in Bangalore where his Europe-based father, Captain R. Aiyar, and Singapore-based mother visit and are surprised that their son has married without even informing them. They travel to Chandigarh to meet with Pinky's family in order to arrange a Hindu wedding and reception.
