The nations of Earth fight as one against the Gamilons, but one by one, Earth's fleets are defeated. When the nations of Earth refuse to surrender, Gamilon begins bombarding Earth with planet bombs, radioactive missiles that look like meteors, which gradually spread deadly radiation all over Earth, forcing what's left of humanity to retreat to underground cities. Queen Starsha of planet Iscandar contacts Earth and promises to provide Cosmo-DNA that can remove the radioactivity and restore Earth to beautiful life. She provides plans to an engine that will allow a brave, young group of technicians to journey more than a hundred thousand light-years to Iscandar, obtain the Cosmo-DNA, and return to Earth within one Earth year. In 2199, an ancient seagoing vessel is fitted with the awesome engine and launched toward Iscandar. Along the way, the intrepid crew must fight the Gamilons, who are determined to prevent the brave voyagers from saving Earth from extinction.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Eddie Allen, Michael Bertolini, Amy Howard Wilson","starList":[{"id":"nm0020479","name":"Eddie Allen"},{"id":"nm2929756","name":"Michael Bertolini"},{"id":"nm0397094","name":"Amy Howard Wilson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0020479","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAxNDE2NjU3NDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDcyNDY3Nzgx._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eddie Allen","asCharacter":"Dashell 'Dash' Jordanas Dashell 'Dash' Jordan…"},{"id":"nm2929756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Bertolini","asCharacter":"Homer Glitchmanas Homer Glitchman"},{"id":"nm0397094","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amy Howard Wilson","asCharacter":"Nova Forresteras Nova Forrester"},{"id":"nm0498597","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lydia Leeds","asCharacter":"Queen Starshaas Queen Starsha…"},{"id":"nm0582079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGRjNzY4MGQtYzVkNC00ODIzLWJkMmEtYTU0OTc3YWEyMWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ3MDIzNzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kenneth Meseroll","asCharacter":"Derek Wildstaras Derek Wildstar"},{"id":"nm0878540","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Tweedy","asCharacter":"Mark Ventureas Mark Venture"},{"id":"nm0708998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gordon Ramsey","asCharacter":"Orion Sr.as Orion Sr.…"},{"id":"nm0194386","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mike Czechopoulos","asCharacter":"Gamilon Colonel Vulgaras Gamilon Colonel Vulgar"},{"id":"nm0490383","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Christopher Collins","asCharacter":"Comet Empire General Direas Comet Empire General Dire…"},{"id":"nm0517456","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Morgan Lofting","asCharacter":"Princess Invidiaas Princess Invidia"},{"id":"nm0069257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Bellucci","asCharacter":"Derek Wildstaras Derek Wildstar"},{"id":"nm0273033","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY2NzkzNDI4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDE2Nzgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Fernandez","asCharacter":"Mark Ventureas Mark Venture"},{"id":"nm0342207","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Grimes","asCharacter":"Galman General Gustafas Galman General Gustaf"},{"id":"nm0650541","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Corinne Orr","asCharacter":"Nova Forresteras Nova Forrester…"},{"id":"nm0358679","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Earl Hammond","asCharacter":"Voicesas Voices"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"Claster Television Productions, Sunwagon Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0040358","name":"Claster Television Productions"},{"id":"co0036327","name":"Sunwagon Productions"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"8.4","imDbRatingVotes":"1403","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"We're off to outer space, we're leaving Mother Earth.
