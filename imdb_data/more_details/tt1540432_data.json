Produced over five years, the documentary chronicles the scene before and after the spotlight that came to town as the White Stripes rose to fame. Starting with the hugely influential band The Gories in the 1980s, the bands of the garage scene are known for two things: an impeccable knowledge of the history of rock and roll and a raucous live show. It Came From Detroit documents the evolution of the scene from underground obscurity to an international trend. As bands such as the White Stripes, The Von Bondies, and the Electric Six started to develop a following overseas, journalists around the world started to hype Detroit as \"The Next Seattle\". We discover how unexpected popularity impacts the musician's lives as more and more bands sign to major labels and tour the world and find out what happens to the small group of friends when not everyone has the same opportunities. Underneath the crumbling shell of Detroit there is a pulse, and a community of passionate musicians that dug back into the roots of rock and roll and made it relevant again.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"James R.
