So Navajos were recruited to become what they call code talkers. They would be assigned to a unit and would communicate with other units using the code so that even though the enemy could listen they couldn't understand what they were saying. And to insure that the code is protected men are assigned to protect it at all costs. One of these men is Joe Enders, a man who sustained an injury that can make him unfit for duty but he manages to avoid it and is told of his duty and that the man he is suppose to protect is Ben Yahzee. Initially there is tension but the two men learn to get along.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins & 4 nominations","directors":"John Woo","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000247","name":"John Woo"}],"writers":"John Rice, Joe Batteer","writerList":[{"id":"nm0723468","name":"John Rice"},{"id":"nm0061337","name":"Joe Batteer"}],"stars":"Nicolas Cage, Adam Beach, Peter Stormare","starList":[{"id":"nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"id":"nm0063440","name":"Adam Beach"},{"id":"nm0001780","name":"Peter Stormare"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000115","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjUxMjE4MTQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc2MDM1NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nicolas Cage","asCharacter":"Joe Endersas Joe Enders"},{"id":"nm0063440","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxMzI0Njc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Beach","asCharacter":"Ben Yahzeeas Ben Yahzee"},{"id":"nm0001780","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTUyMDQ0MTEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDYxMDkz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Stormare","asCharacter":"Hjelmstadas Hjelmstad"},{"id":"nm0001187","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA5ODA1MDM2NDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDM4MDA3MDAy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Noah Emmerich","asCharacter":"Chickas Chick"},{"id":"nm0749263","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWIzZTI1ODUtZTUzMC00NTdiLWFlOTYtZTg4MGZkYmU4YzNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTExOTk5Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark Ruffalo","asCharacter":"Pappasas Pappas"},{"id":"nm0887144","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTBmNmY5ZDItMGMzMS00OTkxLTg2MzYtMGQ4YzJjZTY3NGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUxNDIwMjY@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brian Van Holt","asCharacter":"Harriganas Harrigan"},{"id":"nm0376540","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjc4MTA3NDIzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIwNTU5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Martin Henderson","asCharacter":"Nellieas Nellie"},{"id":"nm0932194","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5Nzk0MzUzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjMzODE2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Roger Willie","asCharacter":"Charlie Whitehorseas Charlie Whitehorse"},{"id":"nm0640323","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTBjYTEyYzUtMDlhYy00NGQ1LTk2NjEtODFmZGFmODMzNmUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frances O'Connor","asCharacter":"Ritaas Rita"},{"id":"nm0000225","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5ODA1ODY2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcwNDczNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christian Slater","asCharacter":"Ox Hendersonas Ox Henderson"},{"id":"nm0005042","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGM3MWZmZWYtYjgxNi00NGU1LThlMjUtMWVkY2FmZGE5Y2VjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzE4ODAxMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Isaacs","asCharacter":"Major Mellitzas Major Mellitz"},{"id":"nm0608121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5NTA3NjgwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTczNjczMg@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Morts","asCharacter":"Fortinoas Fortino"},{"id":"nm0861151","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjcxMmI3NjAtMjllYS00NWM4LWEyOTgtNmZhMzgwYTU5MjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2NjY2NzQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cameron Thor","asCharacter":"Mertensas Mertens"},{"id":"nm0004668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1NjM1MTc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNTcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Cooney","asCharacter":"Ear Doctoras Ear Doctor"},{"id":"nm0651660","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczMDI4NTgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA5NzY5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Holmes Osborne","asCharacter":"Colonel Hollingsas Colonel Hollings"},{"id":"nm0132625","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4Mjg4MTY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc2NjkzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Keith Campbell","asCharacter":"Kittringas Kittring"},{"id":"nm0053366","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzA0Njk1NTAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3ODUxOTE@._V1_Ratio1.1857_AL_.jpg","name":"Clayton J.
