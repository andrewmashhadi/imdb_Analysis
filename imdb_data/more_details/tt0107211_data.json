She finds the perfect spot to build his dream house, and they get loans to finance it. When the recession hits, they stand to lose everything they own, so they go to Las Vegas to have one shot with their last $5000 at winning the money they need. After losing at the tables, they are approached by a suave billionaire and high-stakes gambler, John Gage, who offers them a million dollars for a night with Diana. Indignant but already seduced, Diana and David reluctantly agree. They say money can't buy love. Though the couple agrees that this is a way out of their financial dilemma, it threatens to destroy their relationship. Can the husband and wife survive John's ultimate test?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 7 wins & 8 nominations","directors":"Adrian Lyne","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001490","name":"Adrian Lyne"}],"writers":"Jack Engelhard, Amy Holden Jones","writerList":[{"id":"nm0257209","name":"Jack Engelhard"},{"id":"nm0427468","name":"Amy Holden Jones"}],"stars":"Robert Redford, Demi Moore, Woody Harrelson","starList":[{"id":"nm0000602","name":"Robert Redford"},{"id":"nm0000193","name":"Demi Moore"},{"id":"nm0000437","name":"Woody Harrelson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000602","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1Nzc5MzQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ5OTA0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Redford","asCharacter":"Johnas John…"},{"id":"nm0000193","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc2Mjc1MDE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzAyNDczNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Demi Moore","asCharacter":"Diana Murphyas Diana Murphy"},{"id":"nm0000437","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NDc2ODc4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk2MzAyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Woody Harrelson","asCharacter":"David Murphyas David Murphy"},{"id":"nm0001025","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzAzNDUwODk4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA0MzQ4NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Seymour Cassel","asCharacter":"Mr. Shacklefordas Mr. Shackleford"},{"id":"nm0001624","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzkzNDgzNjEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzODA0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Oliver Platt","asCharacter":"Jeremyas Jeremy"},{"id":"nm0000671","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcxOTUwMDI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyNzkzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Bob Thornton","asCharacter":"Day Tripperas Day Tripper"},{"id":"nm0853067","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1NjEyODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzA1NjA1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rip Taylor","asCharacter":"Mr. Langfordas Mr. Langford"},{"id":"nm0175262","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMzM2MTA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzIxNTM1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Connolly","asCharacter":"Auction M.C.as Auction M.C."},{"id":"nm0112063","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MzIyNTU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU0OTA2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joel Brooks","asCharacter":"Realtoras Realtor"},{"id":"nm0258527","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Pierre Epstein","asCharacter":"Van Burenas Van Buren"},{"id":"nm0957955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4NTAwZmEtNjMxMi00NjlhLTk1MDgtMzhhYzZkZjY0Njc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwODg2MDY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Danny Zorn","asCharacter":"Screenwriteras Screenwriter"},{"id":"nm0922182","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIyNzMyODA3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg3NjcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin West","asCharacter":"Screenwriteras Screenwriter"},{"id":"nm0392496","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4Yjg3YTQtN2NlNS00OWY3LWFlNmUtZjAzYTE5ZjBlZjc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEyNTg2NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Pamela Holt","asCharacter":"David's Girlfriendas David's Girlfriend"},{"id":"nm0059743","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tommy Bush","asCharacter":"David's Fatheras David's Father"},{"id":"nm0182582","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0NTUyNjM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkxMTgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mariclare Costello","asCharacter":"David's Motheras David's Mother"},{"id":"nm0644111","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Curt Odle","asCharacter":"David's Bossas David's Boss"},{"id":"nm0428332","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jedda Jones","asCharacter":"Craps Womanas Craps Woman"},{"id":"nm0412898","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjdjYjE0NGQtYzI3Zi00YzNjLTkzOWQtNmQyZDIyM2QxOTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ0NTk5NzU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Myra J.","asCharacter":"Craps Womanas Craps Woman"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Paramount Pictures","companyList":[{"id":"co0023400","name":"Paramount Pictures"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"6","imDbRatingVotes":"70370","metacriticRating":"35","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$38,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$18,387,632","grossUSA":"$106,614,059","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$266,614,059"},"tagline":"A husband.
