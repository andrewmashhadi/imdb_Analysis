After the death of Kath, Len tells his grieving friend the local gang is harassing him and he is carrying an old bayonet for self-defence. Harry suggests he to go to the police. When Len is beaten and stabbed to death, detective Inspector Alice Frampton and her partner Sergeant Terry Hicock are sent to investigate. They pay Harry a visit but don't have good news; the police have not found any other evidence, other than the bayonet, in order to arrest the hoodlums. This mean that should the case go to trial the gang would claim self-defence. Harry Brown sees that justice will not be granted and decides to take matters into his own hands.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 4 nominations","directors":"Daniel Barber","directorList":[{"id":"nm2905562","name":"Daniel Barber"}],"writers":"Gary Young","writerList":[{"id":"nm0949558","name":"Gary Young"}],"stars":"Michael Caine, Emily Mortimer, David Bradley","starList":[{"id":"nm0000323","name":"Michael Caine"},{"id":"nm0607865","name":"Emily Mortimer"},{"id":"nm0103195","name":"David Bradley"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000323","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNzIwNTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzE1MTUz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Caine","asCharacter":"Harry Brownas Harry Brown"},{"id":"nm0607865","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2NjIzMDg3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ5MzczNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Mortimer","asCharacter":"D.I.
