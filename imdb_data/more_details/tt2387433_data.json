Daniel is currently unemployed, placing the burden of supporting the family on Lacy, who works as a real estate agent. Their two sons enjoy a happy relationship and communicate with each other from their beds via walk-talkie. A number of strange occurrences befall the family. During the night, the contents of the kitchen are rearranged in bizarre configurations. The house alarm is set off when it detects that all entry points were breached simultaneously. Sammy suffers a fit while playing soccer and Lacy is shocked when hundreds of birds suddenly crash into the house. One night, Lacy is awakened by a sound from Sammy's room. When she goes to check on him, through the darkness she sees a figure standing over his bed. She turns on the light to find an empty room. Sammy is found walking away from the house but cannot remember leaving. Lacy, Daniel and Jesse each suffer catatonic episodes and regain consciousness with no memory of their experiences.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Scott Stewart","directorList":[{"id":"nm0829820","name":"Scott Stewart"}],"writers":"Scott Stewart","writerList":[{"id":"nm0829820","name":"Scott Stewart"}],"stars":"Keri Russell, Jake Brennan, Josh Hamilton","starList":[{"id":"nm0005392","name":"Keri Russell"},{"id":"nm3967248","name":"Jake Brennan"},{"id":"nm0357979","name":"Josh Hamilton"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0005392","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA4MDM4MzUzNzZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDM0NjY4NDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Keri Russell","asCharacter":"Lacy Barrettas Lacy Barrett"},{"id":"nm3967248","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGU2ZDIxMzctZThiNC00YTYxLTk1NzctNWI3NjUyYWUyNmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jake Brennan","asCharacter":"Bobby Jessopas Bobby Jessop"},{"id":"nm0357979","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1ODA3MzE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxMzg1MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Hamilton","asCharacter":"Daniel Barrettas Daniel Barrett"},{"id":"nm2023672","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM1NTU3ODMtMjExMi00ZTQ0LWE3OWItYjgyMjA3ZjgyNTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAxNDExMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dakota Goyo","asCharacter":"Jesse Barrettas Jesse Barrett"},{"id":"nm4595603","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4MTUzNTgyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTEwODU5OA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kadan Rockett","asCharacter":"Sam Barrettas Sam Barrett"},{"id":"nm0799777","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzg2NTI5NzQ1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NDEwMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"J.K.
