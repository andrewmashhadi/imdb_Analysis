Orange torments these fruits, veggies, etc. to no end, creating mean-spirited variations on everyone's name, cracking grueling puns, driving them crazy with his nonstop chatter. Only at the end of each episode, where the sudden death of each fruit is caused by a knife, do these poor edibles finally get relieved of their torture.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 4 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Dane Boedigheimer, Bobby Jennings, Kevin Brueck","starList":[{"id":"nm2088529","name":"Dane Boedigheimer"},{"id":"nm4048321","name":"Bobby Jennings"},{"id":"nm3820860","name":"Kevin Brueck"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2088529","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dane Boedigheimer","asCharacter":"Orangeas Orange…"},{"id":"nm4048321","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bobby Jennings","asCharacter":"Grapefruitas Grapefruit…"},{"id":"nm3820860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kevin Brueck","asCharacter":"Grandpa Lemonas Grandpa Lemon…"},{"id":"nm3692558","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGZiZDA5MmUtMmVmNi00NjhlLWI0NzgtYTMxNjk3MGVlODEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Justine Ezarik","asCharacter":"Passion Fruitas Passion Fruit…"},{"id":"nm2411032","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aaron Massey","asCharacter":"Appleas Apple…"},{"id":"nm4684460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Shannon Jones","asCharacter":"Raspberryas Raspberry…"},{"id":"nm3929163","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWRjMmJkZmYtMzMxYS00ZDdhLWJhMTAtOWFhYWU0ZWVkOWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon Bailey","asCharacter":"Avocado #2as Avocado #2…"},{"id":"nm5638899","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Wingate","asCharacter":"Berryas Berry…"},{"id":"nm3333977","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjZjZWVlYjktOTgzNy00MzU2LWI4MmQtYWEwNGE5OTVlZjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk3NTUyOTc@._V1_Ratio1.7143_AL_.jpg","name":"Toby Turner","asCharacter":"Eggplantas Eggplant…"},{"id":"nm0395606","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzFiZTQ3ZTMtY2JmYy00YTdjLTkwZTUtNjE4MWY4M2MyNTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzYyOTM4NDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Horton","asCharacter":"Apple (2012)as Apple (2012)"},{"id":"nm5128595","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steven Zurita","asCharacter":"Big Sharkas Big Shark…"},{"id":"nm5682488","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rebecca Parham","asCharacter":"Adeli Meatas Adeli Meat…"},{"id":"nm4244110","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jess Lizama","asCharacter":"Aunt Grapefruitas Aunt Grapefruit…"},{"id":"nm2561414","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTVhNmYzZWYtMjU3Yi00NmI3LWFmYWItNjFiNDc2NGEyMGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Joe Bereta","asCharacter":"Angry Orangeas Angry Orange…"},{"id":"nm1976204","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rafi Fine","asCharacter":"Cob #1as Cob #1…"},{"id":"nm4345215","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1MTkxNzAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQyOTI2ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brock Baker","asCharacter":"Bananaas Banana…"},{"id":"nm1685278","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA3MDE0MDU0MDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4MzM0MzYx._V1_Ratio1.4286_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Ryan","asCharacter":"Mervinas Mervin…"},{"id":"nm3272700","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Benny Fine","asCharacter":"Cob #2as Cob #2…"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Family, Fantasy","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"}],"companies":"20th Century Fox Television, Warner Bros.
