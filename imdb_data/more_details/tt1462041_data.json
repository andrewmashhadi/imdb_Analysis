For one man, his home is the place he would kill to forget. A family unknowingly moves into a home where several grisly murders were committed ... only to find themselves the killer's next target. Successful publisher Will Atenton (Craig) quit a job in New York City to relocate his wife, Libby (Weisz), and two girls to a quaint New England town. But as they settle into their new life, they discover their perfect home was the scene of the murder of a mother and her children. And the entire city believes it was at the hands of the husband who survived. When Will investigates the tragedy, his only lead comes from Ann Paterson (Watts), a neighbour who was close to the family that died. As Will and Ann piece together the disturbing puzzle, they discover that the story of the last man to leave Will's dream house will be just as horrifying to the one who came next.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 nominations","directors":"Jim Sheridan","directorList":[{"id":"nm0006487","name":"Jim Sheridan"}],"writers":"David Loucka","writerList":[{"id":"nm0521649","name":"David Loucka"}],"stars":"Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz, Naomi Watts","starList":[{"id":"nm0185819","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"id":"nm0001838","name":"Rachel Weisz"},{"id":"nm0915208","name":"Naomi Watts"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0185819","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEzMjk4NDU4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyNjQzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Daniel Craig","asCharacter":"Will Atentonas Will Atenton"},{"id":"nm0001838","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4MzM1MDAwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU4NzQwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rachel Weisz","asCharacter":"Libbyas Libby"},{"id":"nm0915208","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIzMjY1NTA4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk3MDYwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Naomi Watts","asCharacter":"Ann Pattersonas Ann Patterson"},{"id":"nm0000480","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTEwMTEzODkzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI1NDAyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Elias Koteas","asCharacter":"Boyceas Boyce"},{"id":"nm0190744","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQxOTcyNDEyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMzMzYyNTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marton Csokas","asCharacter":"Jack Pattersonas Jack Patterson"},{"id":"nm2855622","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTlkM2U2YWQtMjFmZS00ODVjLTg1ODMtYmRkMWUxMWZmYTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0NjI2Mzg5._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Taylor Geare","asCharacter":"Trishas Trish"},{"id":"nm3637500","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGY5NWFkMTItNGFkNi00NzNiLWEyMDctZmM0NWNjMmVkNjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Claire Geare","asCharacter":"Dee Deeas Dee Dee"},{"id":"nm0289200","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIyZTRjODUtZWQyZS00MDc0LWE0YjQtNDAyMmY4Yzc3YzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2Mjg5Mzk4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rachel G.
