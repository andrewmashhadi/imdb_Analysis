But when duty calls Erotica becomes Stripperella an agent for T.H.U.G.G. and a superhero who fends off nasty villains such as Dr. Cesarean, a plastic surgeon whose evil plans involve giving unexpected women explosive breast implants made of nitroglycerin; Cheapo, a super-villain on a budget who makes his henchman share a gun; and Pushy Galore, a former genetic physicist who has learned to breed animals with designer logos on their skin and makes designer knockoffs out of her ex-husbands. Stripperella has the ability to float to safety from tall distances courtesy of her enhanced hair. Watch out for her patented move Scissor-ella which allows her to knock-out bad guys with her thighs (think Famke Jannsen as Xenia Onatopp in the James Bond film Goldeneye). If she allows you to touch her breasts then look out for trick because a gadget in the chest area of her outfit works as a lie detector and tells Stripperella if someone is lying when they touch it. But the most outragous gadget at her disposal has to be the digital scanner placed under her tongue which she can use to upload pictures to a computer.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Pamela Anderson, Tom Kenny, Maurice LaMarche","starList":[{"id":"nm0000097","name":"Pamela Anderson"},{"id":"nm0444786","name":"Tom Kenny"},{"id":"nm0005606","name":"Maurice LaMarche"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000097","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjQ5MDkyMGEtYmI0OS00MmM2LWE0MmEtZmQ2NjA5MzYyYTFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjIwMTQzOTU@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Pamela Anderson","asCharacter":"Stripperellaas Stripperella…"},{"id":"nm0444786","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3MzkzNDI0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTMyNzE3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Kenny","asCharacter":"Kevin Calhounas Kevin Calhoun…"},{"id":"nm0005606","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmI2N2FlYzEtMzEyMi00NWQ1LTk0MjYtNzI2MGRjMmYxZDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maurice LaMarche","asCharacter":"Chief Stroganoffas Chief Stroganoff…"},{"id":"nm0848154","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1OTgzODEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY1ODkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jill Talley","asCharacter":"Giselleas Giselle…"},{"id":"nm0410451","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2MTU3MDA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI3ODM5MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sirena Irwin","asCharacter":"Persephoneas Persephone…"},{"id":"nm2623692","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kirsten Kairos","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0698681","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1NDM5MDUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDkzODMwNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Greg Proops","asCharacter":"Bernardas Bernard"},{"id":"nm0071818","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNTQwMjU2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMzgxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Bennett","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0001083","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3NTkzNDY1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ3ODU0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon Cryer","asCharacter":"Daveas Dave…"},{"id":"nm0573093","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzY3NTcwYmMtZDQxMi00NDBlLWIzMTctZGIzMGM5NTVkN2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Vince McMahon","asCharacter":"Dirk McMahonas Dirk McMahon"},{"id":"nm0001855","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MzM4ODM4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDU1Mzky._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Wilson","asCharacter":"Directoras Director…"},{"id":"nm0048389","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4MzkzMzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDIwMjM4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dee Bradley Baker","asCharacter":"Babyas Baby…"},{"id":"nm0267656","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzNTc0NTE4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM2NjAz._V1_Ratio1.2429_AL_.jpg","name":"John Farley","asCharacter":"Henchman #2as Henchman #2"},{"id":"nm0000725","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGU2ZTk2OTctODVmNS00M2Q5LTkwOWQtYTVmNjE4NzM0YjU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEzNTc2NjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joey Lauren Adams","asCharacter":"Cattas Catt"},{"id":"nm0267659","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNTY3NzUzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjYyNjgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin P.
