Kimmel's family and friends take part in the festivities, including his Cousin Sal, Uncle Frank (until his death in 2011), and childhood friend Cleto Escobedo III, who leads the show's house band. Recurring segments include the FCC-pleasing 'This Week in Unnecessary Censorship' in which they take TV clips and \"bleep and blur things whether they need it or not,\" as Kimmel describes it. But it's too bad they consistently run out of time for Matt Damon's segment.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 3 Primetime Emmys, 8 wins & 75 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jimmy Kimmel, Cleto and the Cletones, Guillermo Rodriguez","starList":[{"id":"nm0453994","name":"Jimmy Kimmel"},{"id":"nm7233717","name":"Cleto and the Cletones"},{"id":"nm2281865","name":"Guillermo Rodriguez"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0453994","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzFlOTY3MGUtOGM5MS00YTZiLWIzMDItOGE1Y2I1ZGRjMGMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ1NTc5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.1286_AL_.jpg","name":"Jimmy Kimmel","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host…"},{"id":"nm7233717","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cleto and the Cletones","asCharacter":"Themselves - House Bandas Themselves - House Band…"},{"id":"nm2281865","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwODU5NjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI1NDcxOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Guillermo Rodriguez","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1309872","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cleto Escobedo III","asCharacter":"Self - Musical Directoras Self - Musical Director…"},{"id":"nm0057113","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dicky Barrett","asCharacter":"Self - Announceras Self - Announcer…"},{"id":"nm1412969","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Frank Potenza","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0406237","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmY1Y2MyYTYtZmRkMC00OWYwLTk2NWQtZTQ1MDI3MzVhYWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA2NjY2NzQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sal Iacono","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0004805","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI2MDQwMDY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTc3NzYz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Carolla","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0026364","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMjk3MzM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU1MDg0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anthony Anderson","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest…"},{"id":"nm1817943","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwOTE5OTAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTEwNzQ2OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anna Vocino","asCharacter":"Alexa VOas Alexa VO…"},{"id":"nm0004980","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU2NTEyMjM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2MTU5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kathy Griffin","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest…"},{"id":"nm2432010","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2ZlOThmY2QtMzZiNy00ZjhhLThhZDktN2Q0ZjM1M2Y1ZjY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzgyNzc1MTQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lora Cain","asCharacter":"Self - Announceras Self - Announcer"},{"id":"nm0068338","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1Njc0MTUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg1MjEwNDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kristen Bell","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest…"},{"id":"nm2943092","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Veatrice","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0000354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NzYzNDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Damon","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest…"},{"id":"nm0004979","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxMTg4OTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUyMDE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Alan Grier","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm3312780","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Corey Thompson","asCharacter":"Corey The Chewbacca Guyas Corey The Chewbacca Guy"},{"id":"nm0005450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1NzQwNTkyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIxNjQ3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Spade","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Music, Talk-Show","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Music","value":"Music"},{"key":"Talk-Show","value":"Talk-Show"}],"companies":"Jackhole Industries, 12:05 Productions, ABC Signature","companyList":[{"id":"co0071163","name":"Jackhole Industries"},{"id":"co0299638","name":"12:05 Productions"},{"id":"co0209226","name":"ABC Signature"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-14","imDbRating":"6.5","imDbRatingVotes":"16176","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"You.
