She, for some reason, sees otherworldly creatures and acts as a magnet for them. Because of that, her life is ruined and even her closest relatives, as the only thing she can rely on, are disappearing one after another. Chise, being absolutely alone, even thinks about ending her life. However, instead of resorting to suicide, she meets a person that suggests her selling her life to someone who would take her in. And Chise does find a person that wants to buy her--Elias. After some time, the two are teleported to Elias' home. Warm, quiet and extremely cozy--that home is everything Chise has ever dreamed of. Now Chise becomes Elias' apprentice, who is a very respected mage. As a mage, Chise will now have to find out more about the world she is afraid of, about the world that ruined her life and took everything, which was important to her.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 6 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Atsumi Tanezaki, Christopher Sabat, Todd
