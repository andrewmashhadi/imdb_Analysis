Sparks fly, but there's one little problem: Noah just happens to be the brother of her best friend, Lee, (Joel Courtney) and is absolutely off limits according to the rules of their friendship pact. Elle's life is turned upside down when she realizes that she must ultimately make a choice: follow the rules or follow her heart. Based on Beth Reekle's self-published coming-of-age novel that became an international sensation, THE KISSING BOOTH is a Netflix Film, written and directed by Vince Marcello.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations","directors":"Vince Marcello","directorList":[{"id":"nm1479803","name":"Vince Marcello"}],"writers":"Vince Marcello, Beth Reekles","writerList":[{"id":"nm1479803","name":"Vince Marcello"},{"id":"nm6564541","name":"Beth Reekles"}],"stars":"Joey King, Jacob Elordi, Joel Courtney","starList":[{"id":"nm1428821","name":"Joey King"},{"id":"nm8624059","name":"Jacob Elordi"},{"id":"nm1525807","name":"Joel Courtney"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1428821","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODJmZjUyZDUtYWU1MC00YmNjLWEzODgtOTFlMDRjZDQ0ZjRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMzMjAyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joey King","asCharacter":"Shelly 'Elle' Evansas Shelly 'Elle' Evans"},{"id":"nm8624059","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE5NGRhNzMtZTRlMC00YzY0LWEzYzMtMTU1ZjAyMTBiNDRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAwNTgwOTk@._V1_Ratio1.4571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jacob Elordi","asCharacter":"Noah Flynnas Noah Flynn"},{"id":"nm1525807","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzM1YjUyNGMtZGRjZC00MzJkLWI0ODktMTkyMWQxZjI1OTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM5MTY0MjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joel Courtney","asCharacter":"Lee Flynnas Lee Flynn"},{"id":"nm9833473","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Megan du Plessis","asCharacter":"Shelly 'Elle' Evans (Age 4)as Shelly 'Elle' Evans (Age 4)"},{"id":"nm9833474","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lincoln Pearson","asCharacter":"Lee Flynn (Age 4)as Lee Flynn (Age 4)"},{"id":"nm9833476","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Fokkens","asCharacter":"Lee Flynn (Age 7)as Lee Flynn (Age 7)"},{"id":"nm0421252","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODA1ZGE5ZTgtYjE0Mi00Y2VkLThmNzItNjc2MjEyYzU1YTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY3Nzk5NTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Jennings","asCharacter":"Mike Evansas Mike Evans"},{"id":"nm7445448","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chloe Williams","asCharacter":"Joni Evansas Joni Evans"},{"id":"nm9833477","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Miccoli","asCharacter":"Noah Flynn (Age 9)as Noah Flynn (Age 9)"},{"id":"nm9833478","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Juliet Blacher","asCharacter":"Shelly 'Elle' Evans (Age 11)as Shelly 'Elle' Evans (Age 11)"},{"id":"nm9833479","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jesse Rowan-Goldberg","asCharacter":"Lee Flynn (Age 11)as Lee Flynn (Age 11)"},{"id":"nm9161294","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chase Dallas","asCharacter":"Noah Flynn (Age 13)as Noah Flynn (Age 13)"},{"id":"nm7193305","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGIwMjZlODQtYjI2YS00ZTUxLTgxYjAtZTg1NDBmMDU5MzcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTg3MTc0MDY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Carson White","asCharacter":"Brad Evansas Brad Evans"},{"id":"nm3031646","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGEyZDJkMmYtMTQ5OC00ODgyLTkyZDMtZDU5YTc2MWVhMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hilton Pelser","asCharacter":"Barryas Barry"},{"id":"nm9082953","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Judd Krok","asCharacter":"Ollieas Ollie"},{"id":"nm8771760","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sanda Shandu","asCharacter":"Randyas Randy"},{"id":"nm7760934","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjJiMDg0YTMtMGU4Ni00NTk3LWFmNDYtYjI0YjZkYzMxMWFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1MDAxNjI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joshua Daniel Eady","asCharacter":"Tuppenas Tuppen"},{"id":"nm0605514","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzVhNjc3NDYtZjdlYi00MmNmLWJjMzctODYzOGJkNmI5M2MzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAxMTkzOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"D.
