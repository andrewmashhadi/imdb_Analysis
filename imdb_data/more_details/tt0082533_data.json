After police officers find them in a peep-show cabin and shoot Eddie, Karen becomes emotionally disturbed and loses her memory. Hoping to conquer her inner demons, she heads for the Colony, a secluded retreat where the creepy residents are rather too eager to make her feel at home. There also seems to be a bizarre connection between Eddie Quist and this supposedly safe haven. And when, after nights of being tormented by unearthly cries, Karen ventures into the forest and makes a terrifying discovery.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 3 nominations","directors":"Joe Dante","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001102","name":"Joe Dante"}],"writers":"Gary Brandner, John Sayles, Terence H.
