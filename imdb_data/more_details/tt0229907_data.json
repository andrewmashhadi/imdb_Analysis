It was taped in front of a live studio audience at NBC Burbank Ca. Concert footage was included at times. During the show's run there were some reruns on Saturday nights and 3 hr. compilation specials. Wolfman Jack appeared each week as announcer and main host, with a different guest host each week. Pop Rock and comedy performers appeared on the show. In changing times, the show's time slot was later filled by \"Friday Night Videos\"(1983), with the sudden popularity of the music video.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys, 2 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Wolfman Jack, Helen Reddy, Donna Summer","starList":[{"id":"nm0413125","name":"Wolfman Jack"},{"id":"nm0714761","name":"Helen Reddy"},{"id":"nm0838595","name":"Donna Summer"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0413125","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzMjY4ODgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE1MjM4Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Wolfman Jack","asCharacter":"Self -
