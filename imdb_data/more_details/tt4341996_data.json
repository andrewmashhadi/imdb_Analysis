Charles Falco opted to go undercover and for the next three years he led a crazy and dangerous life infiltrating the Vagos motorcycle gang, collecting evidence while faced with the constant risk that he might be discovered and become one of the gang's victims. Each episode unfolds a different step in Falco's covert investigation into their illegal activities, while across the series, the drama builds as carefully constructed character arcs unfold bitter personal rivalries. These tensions finally erupt when the gang's Vice President is killed in a motorcycle accident, unleashing a chain of unforeseen consequences that ultimately tear the gang apart. With suspicions about Falco's true identity mounting, the operation threatens to unravel, leading to a tense and dramatic conclusion. Drawing on the wealth of material from Falco's time under cover, along with broader documented historical research of inter gang rivalry, this series dramatically captures the reality of outlaw biker counter culture: a world where freedom is equated with the right to carry guns and trade drugs with impunity, and respect can be earned through fear... following the conclusion of his undercover operation with the Vagos, the reformed Falco goes into witness protection... but hooked on the adrenaline rush of undercover work he volunteers to go undercover inside not just one, but two more biker gangs...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Damon Runyan, Ian Matthews, Ari
