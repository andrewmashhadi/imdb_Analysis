Joe takes her out to the Blue Whale. By the time she gets there, she dismisses the whole thing as silly and apologizes to him. But Joe is more certain than she that something is wrong, especially after her father and Barnabas Collins come in. She doesn't want to be near them. But she won't tell Joe why. She doesn't even seem to know why herself.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Lela Swift","directorList":[{"id":"nm0842611","name":"Lela Swift"}],"writers":"Dan Curtis, Ron Sproat, Art Wallace","writerList":[{"id":"nm0193303","name":"Dan Curtis"},{"id":"nm0819821","name":"Ron Sproat"},{"id":"nm0908526","name":"Art Wallace"}],"stars":"Mitchell Ryan, Jonathan Frid, David Ford","starList":[{"id":"nm0752751","name":"Mitchell Ryan"},{"id":"nm0294847","name":"Jonathan Frid"},{"id":"nm0285596","name":"David Ford"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0752751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3ODQ5OTUzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTAzNjcz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mitchell Ryan","asCharacter":"Burke Devlinas Burke Devlin"},{"id":"nm0294847","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjYwOTI0MDkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ4MzU2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Frid","asCharacter":"Barnabas Collinsas Barnabas Collins"},{"id":"nm0285596","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMyNTI5NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNzgzNDE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"David Ford","asCharacter":"Sam Evansas Sam Evans"},{"id":"nm0189402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1MjM5Mjg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMjc5MzE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Joel Crothers","asCharacter":"Joe Haskellas Joe Haskell"},{"id":"nm0779421","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2FlNDMzOWQtZTk4NS00MGMzLTg5YzgtYjQyMTU4ZWUwZDBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjM4MDEzNjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kathryn Leigh Scott","asCharacter":"Maggie Evansas Maggie Evans"},{"id":"nm0411308","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNzA5NTA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk5NzkwMzE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Alexandra Isles","asCharacter":"Victoria Wintersas Victoria Winters"},{"id":"nm0442598","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dorrie Kavanaugh","asCharacter":"Woman in Maggie's Dreamas Woman in Maggie's Dream"},{"id":"nm9490873","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"George McCoy","asCharacter":"Blue Whale Customeras Blue Whale Customer"},{"id":"nm0187673","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEzMTUzMzU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQyMzU2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob O'Connell","asCharacter":"Bartender Bob Rooneyas Bartender Bob Rooney"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Fantasy, Horror","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"},{"key":"Horror","value":"Horror"}],"companies":"Dan Curtis Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0076023","name":"Dan Curtis Productions"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-PG","imDbRating":"7.7","imDbRatingVotes":"65","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"nightmare,eerie,seeing self in coffin,old dark house,vampire","keywordList":["nightmare","eerie","seeing self in coffin","old dark house","vampire"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0059978","seriesTitle":"Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse","seriesFullTitle":"Dark Shadows: The Vampire Curse (TV Series 1966â€“1971)","seriesYear":"1966","seriesYearEnd":"1971","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"225","previousEpisodeId":"tt0857765","nextEpisodeId":"tt0857767"},"errorMessage":null}
