The order is divided into twenty-one families, with over 1,600 species, but the specimens used to illustrate this educational picture are the commonest of the tribe and, therefore, the most interesting to the average man. The lizard is tracked to its native haunt, a tuft of grass in a quiet glade, and followed on a hunt for its breakfast. It meets with a caterpillar, its favorite dish. Many of these little reptiles are trained, which can easily be done, and become great pets. It proves its value as an assistant to the farmer when it uses its sharp claws to climb trees, where it plays havoc with the small insects which annually destroy millions of dollars' worth of vegetation.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Raymond L.
