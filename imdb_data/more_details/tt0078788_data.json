The mission: To seek out a mysterious Green Beret Colonel, Walter Kurtz, whose army has crossed the border into Cambodia and is conducting hit-and-run missions against the Viet Cong and NVA. The army believes Kurtz has gone completely insane and Willard's job is to eliminate him. Willard, sent up the Nung River on a U.S. Navy patrol boat, discovers that his target is one of the most decorated officers in the U.S. Army. His crew meets up with surfer-type Lt-Colonel Kilgore, head of a U.S Army helicopter cavalry group which eliminates a Viet Cong outpost to provide an entry point into the Nung River. After some hair-raising encounters, in which some of his crew are killed, Willard, Lance and Chef reach Colonel Kurtz's outpost, beyond the Do Lung Bridge. Now, after becoming prisoners of Kurtz, will Willard & the others be able to fulfill their mission?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #54 | Won 2 Oscars, 21 wins & 33 nominations total","directors":"Francis Ford Coppola","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000338","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"writers":"John Milius, Francis Ford Coppola, Michael Herr","writerList":[{"id":"nm0587518","name":"John Milius"},{"id":"nm0000338","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"},{"id":"nm0380282","name":"Michael Herr"}],"stars":"Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall","starList":[{"id":"nm0000640","name":"Martin Sheen"},{"id":"nm0000008","name":"Marlon Brando"},{"id":"nm0000380","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000640","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTM1MTA5MTY0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ4OTUzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Martin Sheen","asCharacter":"Captain Benjamin L.
