Linus is all work -- busily running the family corporate empire with no time for a wife and family. David is all play -- technically employed in the family business but never showing up for work, spending all his time entertaining, and having been married and divorced three times. Sabrina Fairchild is the young, shy, and awkward daughter of the household chauffeur, who has been infatuated with David all her life, but whom David hardly notices till she goes away to Paris for two years and returns an elegant, sophisticated, beautiful woman. Suddenly, she finds she's captured David's attention, but just as she does so, she finds herself also falling in love with Linus, and she finds that Linus is also falling in love with her.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 7 wins & 8 nominations total","directors":"Billy Wilder","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000697","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"writers":"Billy Wilder, Samuel A.
