They receive additional coaching on these dances by 2005 world American ballroom dancing champion Nick Kosovich. The four also head into makeover week for a photo shoot with Life & Style magazine. The experience assists them all with their self confidence. Beyond this boost, Alicia is still having difficulty in accepting how her slimmed down body is affecting her emotional psyche. They also head into green week, where Meg provides them with recyclable shopping bags, and certain costumes for the week are recycled from bits and pieces of previously worn costumes. The top three contestants for the week head into next week's finale.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Michael Simon","directorList":[{"id":"nm0800301","name":"Michael Simon"}],"writers":"Lisa Ann Walter","writerList":[{"id":"nm0910076","name":"Lisa Ann Walter"}],"stars":"Marissa Jaret Winokur, Mayte Garcia, Lisa Ann Walter","starList":[{"id":"nm0935441","name":"Marissa Jaret Winokur"},{"id":"nm0563105","name":"Mayte Garcia"},{"id":"nm0910076","name":"Lisa Ann Walter"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0935441","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDhmNjZiMjAtNmJlZi00NGI2LTlhZTktYjk5ODQ0ZjljNDU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzA3MjU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marissa Jaret Winokur","asCharacter":"Self -
