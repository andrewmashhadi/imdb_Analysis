The title character, Alice Hyatt, is an aspiring singer who arrives in Phoenix with her teen-age son Tommy, after the death of her truck-driver husband. Alice is hired at a diner owned by Mel Sharples, a gravel-voiced, male-chauvinist fry cook. She waitresses at Mel's Diner while awaiting her big break. Her fellow waitresses are raucous redhead Flo and naïve Vera. Flo is later replaced by Southern blonde Belle, who is soon replaced by spunky curly-haired Jolene. Alice and her friends experience several interesting years together at Mel's Diner, which is frequented by quirky truckers, repairmen, and other blue-collar types, and by several Hollywood celebrities who appear as themselves.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 8 Primetime Emmys, 10 wins & 22 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Linda Lavin, Vic Tayback, Beth Howland","starList":[{"id":"nm0492089","name":"Linda Lavin"},{"id":"nm0851861","name":"Vic Tayback"},{"id":"nm0398191","name":"Beth Howland"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0492089","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTE3NjkzOTM2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAzMTA5MzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Linda Lavin","asCharacter":"Alice Hyattas Alice Hyatt…"},{"id":"nm0851861","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczODIwNDYwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU4ODUwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vic Tayback","asCharacter":"Mel Sharplesas Mel Sharples"},{"id":"nm0398191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0MTIyODgzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2ODAwOTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Beth Howland","asCharacter":"Vera Louise Gormanas Vera Louise Gorman"},{"id":"nm0571639","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3NDE3MzU3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjExNTg2OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Philip McKeon","asCharacter":"Tommy Hyattas Tommy Hyatt…"},{"id":"nm0391072","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0NDIwOTU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwMTExOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Polly Holliday","asCharacter":"Flo Castleberryas Flo Castleberry"},{"id":"nm0922927","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNDIyMjE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4NzY5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Celia Weston","asCharacter":"Jolene Hunnicuttas Jolene Hunnicutt"},{"id":"nm0438322","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0NDYxNjIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE1NzM0OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marvin Kaplan","asCharacter":"Henryas Henry"},{"id":"nm0132416","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Duane R.
