Because of his ordinary looks, he is approached by a pair of sinister people named Smith and Jones. Pretending to be cops, Smith and Jones kidnap Lynn and confront Gene with a simple choice -- kill California governor Eleanor Grant in 90 minutes or less, or Lynn will die. Watson is given a gun, six bullets, and a name tag, and he is told to go to the Westin Bonaventure Hotel and kill Eleanor, who is giving an afternoon speech. While Jones is watching Lynn in a van, Smith watches Watson in order to prevent Watson from alerting the authorities. Watson must quickly find some way to get himself and Lynn out of this seemingly impossible situation.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"John Badham","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000824","name":"John Badham"}],"writers":"Patrick Sheane Duncan","writerList":[{"id":"nm0242059","name":"Patrick Sheane Duncan"}],"stars":"Johnny Depp, Christopher Walken, Courtney Chase","starList":[{"id":"nm0000136","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"id":"nm0000686","name":"Christopher Walken"},{"id":"nm0153733","name":"Courtney Chase"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000136","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0ODU5Nzk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2ODgyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Johnny Depp","asCharacter":"Gene Watsonas Gene Watson"},{"id":"nm0000686","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA4ODUyNDQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODk2MTYz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Walken","asCharacter":"Mr. Smithas Mr. Smith"},{"id":"nm0153733","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NDA3NzAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzgxMDAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Courtney Chase","asCharacter":"Lynn Watsonas Lynn Watson"},{"id":"nm0001165","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5MTc0MDA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODY4Njg2Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles S.
