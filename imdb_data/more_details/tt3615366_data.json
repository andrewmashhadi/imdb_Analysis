But all he finds are women keen to know how he'd support a wife financially and, as Nazir isn't able to support himself financially, it's all a little disastrous. It's even worse when Fahmida, chaperoning her friend Yasmin, insults Nazir for his fecklessness. Nazir leaves, but when he boards the bus home he finds he hasn't got the bus fare and, spotting Fahmida, begs her for the money. To stop the embarrassment of Nazir holding everyone up, she gives him the fare. When they find themselves sitting next to each other, bit by bit they begin a conversation that to their surprise shows they have more in common than they thought. Will Fahmida allow her prejudice against Nazir's poverty to get in the way of a potentially beautiful friendship? Or perhaps more? My Jihad is a tender and funny love story told on a night bus journey home.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"George Bukhari, Jaden Sidhu, Amer Patel","starList":[{"id":"nm6496382","name":"George Bukhari"},{"id":"nm10958405","name":"Jaden Sidhu"},{"id":"nm5376174","name":"Amer Patel"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm6496382","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjgyMjYyZGUtN2FiMC00YjI0LWIwYjMtYzU5MGY4YmU5OGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc3ODYwMDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George Bukhari","asCharacter":"Khalilas Khalil"},{"id":"nm10958405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGFlZmZiYzEtNTA0Zi00MzA1LTlkNGUtOThiMGQwNjk2YjE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTkzOTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jaden Sidhu","asCharacter":"Speed Dateras Speed Dater"},{"id":"nm5376174","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amer Patel","asCharacter":"Photographeras Photographer"},{"id":"nm2165929","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2UwNDA2MDctYjc2My00ZGE0LTkyOWQtNzliMjVhOWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc2MDk5MDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anjli Mohindra","asCharacter":"Fahmidaas Fahmida"},{"id":"nm3778244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDAwNjg5M2UtNWFhMS00MDUzLThhODItNzE0MTc1ZDJkODNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Mandeep Dhillon","asCharacter":"Yasminas Yasmin"},{"id":"nm4453032","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5MGNiMWItZmMwNC00MTZiLTk2NWMtYWUxMTRjYjJmNDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY4MjU3NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hamza Jeetooa","asCharacter":"Naziras Nazir"},{"id":"nm4701008","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Cowlin","asCharacter":"Drunk Man on Busas Drunk Man on Bus"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Comedy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"BBC Drama Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0231124","name":"BBC Drama Productions"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"7.8","imDbRatingVotes":"119","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"speed dating,bus journey,love,muslim","keywordList":["speed dating","bus journey","love","muslim"],"similars":[{"id":"tt2358629","title":"Some Girls","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyNzQwMzg4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgzMzU3MzE@._V1_Ratio0.7053_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.6"},{"id":"tt11846996","title":"Vigil","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTc2MzdiYmItZWUxMi00NjlhLThhZWMtYTQ0YTQwZTM3MmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.4"},{"id":"tt8338762","title":"The Nest","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGRjYzI5ZGUtZGJjYy00ZTYyLWJlNzItNWM0MDc0ZDVmM2IwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.3"},{"id":"tt7493974","title":"Bodyguard","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTQ2YmU5YWYtYTdhMS00YjdmLThlMWMtMWVkZGVmNTVhOWE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODEyMzI2OTE@._V1_Ratio0.6860_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.1"},{"id":"tt7475578","title":"Munich: The Edge of War","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODIwMDE0MTktZTVjNS00OTVmLTg1MDEtOWNhMmUzYmNkM2UyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTg1MDQzMDU@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.8"}],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Al Mackay, Shakeel Ahmed","creatorList":[{"id":"nm2126148","name":"Al Mackay"},{"id":"nm1061501","name":"Shakeel Ahmed"}],"seasons":["1"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
