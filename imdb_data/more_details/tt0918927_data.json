A charismatic priest, Father Flynn, is trying to upend the school's strict customs, which have long been fiercely guarded by Sister Aloysius Beauvier, the iron-gloved Principal who believes in the power of fear-based discipline. The winds of political change are sweeping through the community, and indeed, the school has just accepted its first black student, Donald Miller. But when Sister James, a hopeful innocent, shares with Sister Aloysius her guilt-inducing suspicion that Father Flynn is paying too much personal attention to Donald, Sister Aloysius sets off on a personal crusade to unearth the truth and to expunge Flynn from the school. Now, without a shard of proof besides her moral certainty, Sister Aloysius locks into a battle of wills with Father Flynn which threatens to tear apart the community with irrevocable consequences.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 5 Oscars, 25 wins & 97 nominations total","directors":"John Patrick Shanley","directorList":[{"id":"nm0788234","name":"John Patrick Shanley"}],"writers":"John Patrick Shanley","writerList":[{"id":"nm0788234","name":"John Patrick Shanley"}],"stars":"Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams","starList":[{"id":"nm0000658","name":"Meryl Streep"},{"id":"nm0000450","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman"},{"id":"nm0010736","name":"Amy Adams"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000658","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU4Mjk5MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Meryl Streep","asCharacter":"Sister Aloysius Beauvieras Sister Aloysius Beauvier"},{"id":"nm0000450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","asCharacter":"Father Brendan Flynnas Father Brendan Flynn"},{"id":"nm0010736","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg2NTk2MTgxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjcxMjAzMTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Adams","asCharacter":"Sister Jamesas Sister James"},{"id":"nm0205626","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzUxNjM4ODI1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTEwNDE2OTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Viola Davis","asCharacter":"Mrs. Milleras Mrs. Miller"},{"id":"nm0238541","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIyNDcyMDgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzc4NTgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alice Drummond","asCharacter":"Sister Veronicaas Sister Veronica"},{"id":"nm0624240","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjI2YWE0OTQtOGFiZS00YjA3LWFiNWYtZDA3ZmMyMWNkYWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Audrie Neenan","asCharacter":"Sister Raymondas Sister Raymond"},{"id":"nm0088964","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2ODE4NjMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYxMjMxMzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Susan Blommaert","asCharacter":"Mrs. Carsonas Mrs. Carson"},{"id":"nm0696387","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQzNTkwNzkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU1ODY2OTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Carrie Preston","asCharacter":"Christine Hurleyas Christine Hurley"},{"id":"nm0182569","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEzMzcyMDIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzM2NTc3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Costelloe","asCharacter":"Warren Hurleyas Warren Hurley"},{"id":"nm2899705","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjhlNDE1ZDQtMTFlNi00ODcyLTk1YzEtM2I1M2Q3NWFkNjczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc3MDE0MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lloyd Clay Brown","asCharacter":"Jimmy Hurleyas Jimmy Hurley"},{"id":"nm1682706","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joseph Foster","asCharacter":"Donald Milleras Donald Miller"},{"id":"nm3133844","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzMDIxMzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgwMDQwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Roukis","asCharacter":"William Londonas William London"},{"id":"nm3213880","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Haklar Dezso","asCharacter":"Zither Playeras Zither Player"},{"id":"nm3212394","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Frank Shanley","asCharacter":"Kevinas Kevin"},{"id":"nm3213288","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert Ridgell","asCharacter":"Organistas Organist"},{"id":"nm3212860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sarah Giovanniello","asCharacter":"Choir Singeras Choir Singer"},{"id":"nm3213543","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Katie Shelnitz","asCharacter":"Choir Singeras Choir Singer"},{"id":"nm3212807","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aaron O'Neill","asCharacter":"Choir Singeras Choir Singer"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Mystery","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"}],"companies":"Goodspeed Productions, Scott Rudin Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0258162","name":"Goodspeed Productions"},{"id":"co0093765","name":"Scott Rudin Productions"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"PG-13","imDbRating":"7.5","imDbRatingVotes":"128247","metacriticRating":"68","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$20,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$507,226","grossUSA":"$33,446,470","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$51,699,984"},"tagline":"There is no evidence.
