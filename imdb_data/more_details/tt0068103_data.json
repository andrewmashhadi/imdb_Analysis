She's a liberal, independent woman living in Tuckahoe, New York with her fourth husband Walter, owner of Findlay's Friendly Appliances; Carol Traynor, her divorced daughter from her second marriage; and Carol's son Philip. Other characters included: Dr. Arthur Harmon, Walter's conservative best friend from their Army days--he and Maude were always at odds about politics and just about everything; and Vivian Cavender-Harmon, Maude's naive best friend from their college days who married Harmon in season three. During the show's run, Maude went through three maids: Florida Evans, Nell Naugutuck, and Victoria Butterfield; but Florida and Mrs. Naugutuck were the most memorable. Although it was a situation comedy, it dealt with serious and often controversial issues, much like Norman Lear's other shows \"All In The Family\", \"One Day At a Time\", and \"Good Times.\"","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy, 5 wins & 25 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Bea Arthur, Bill Macy, Conrad Bain","starList":[{"id":"nm0037735","name":"Bea Arthur"},{"id":"nm0534409","name":"Bill Macy"},{"id":"nm0047699","name":"Conrad Bain"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0037735","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTkzNDg0ODg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDEwOTEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bea Arthur","asCharacter":"Maude Findlayas Maude Findlay"},{"id":"nm0534409","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NjI5MjczM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTYzODU1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Macy","asCharacter":"Walter Findlayas Walter Findlay"},{"id":"nm0047699","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAyNjAwODYxNjNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDE1Njk2OTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Conrad Bain","asCharacter":"Dr. Arthur Harmonas Dr. Arthur Harmon"},{"id":"nm0000105","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzllZmJjOWEtNmFkZi00NjM3LWE1MzAtYmQyOTZmNjY5N2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMyNDM0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adrienne Barbeau","asCharacter":"Carol Traynoras Carol Traynor"},{"id":"nm0001516","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3NTg4MjQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAzODM1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rue McClanahan","asCharacter":"Vivian Cavender Harmonas Vivian Cavender Harmon…"},{"id":"nm0045968","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzUwNzc4MjMwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcwMTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Hermione Baddeley","asCharacter":"Mrs. Nell Naugatuckas Mrs. Nell Naugatuck"},{"id":"nm0738354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAzMzc0NTQ3ODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQwNDEzNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Esther Rolle","asCharacter":"Florida Evansas Florida Evans"},{"id":"nm0607088","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Brian Morrison","asCharacter":"Phillipas Phillip…"},{"id":"nm0641729","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwNDExMTY0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIwOTkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"J.
