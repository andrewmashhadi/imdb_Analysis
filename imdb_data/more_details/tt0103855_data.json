The bodyguard ruffles the singer's feathers and most of her entourage by tightening security more than they feel is necessary. The bodyguard is haunted by the fact that he was on Reagan's secret service staff but wasn't there to prevent the attack by Hinckley. Eventually the bodyguard and the singer start an affair, and she begins to believe his precautions are necessary when the stalker strikes close to home.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 10 wins & 21 nominations total","directors":"Mick Jackson","directorList":[{"id":"nm0413875","name":"Mick
