Len offers to talk to Steve but Elsie stops him. Dot is put out when Gregg can't take her out. Gary wants to avoid meeting Steve to avoid paying him the gambling debts he owes him. Spurred on by the interest the yanks are taking in some of the women in the street, Hilda nags Stan for not doing the same with her. Emily helps out at St. Mary's nursery. Reverend James asks her to return later as he has a business proposition to put to her. Stan pays for some flowers to be sent to Hilda to make the peace. Ena arrives at the Corner Shop determined to have it out with Maggie. She also accuses Val of taking a poor pensioner's job. They find out from Emily that Ena told the vicar that the shop was too much for her feet. Hilda thinks one of the yanks sent her the flowers. Reverend James asks Emily to be his assistant at the nursery. Elsie can't decide what to do about Steve. Val silences Ena when she tells her that she knows about her feet. Elsie prepares herself to tell Steve 'no' for the last time. In the taxi she hears over the radio that Len is at Steve's. She asks the taxi to take her home. Hilda fails to make Stan jealous about the flowers. The police arrive to tell Elsie that Steve is dead.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"Tony Warren","writerList":[{"id":"nm0912726","name":"Tony Warren"}],"stars":"Irene Sutcliffe, William Roache, Anne Reid","starList":[{"id":"nm0840002","name":"Irene Sutcliffe"},{"id":"nm0730075","name":"William Roache"},{"id":"nm0717176","name":"Anne Reid"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0840002","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Irene Sutcliffe","asCharacter":"Maggie Cleggas Maggie Clegg"},{"id":"nm0730075","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI5MTE4MzM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE2MTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"William Roache","asCharacter":"Kenneth Barlowas Kenneth Barlow"},{"id":"nm0717176","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODU2NDc5NTExMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM2OTE3._V1_Ratio1.4286_AL_.jpg","name":"Anne Reid","asCharacter":"Valerie Barlowas Valerie Barlow"},{"id":"nm0220263","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5NTY5NDY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjMwMDQ0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Eileen Derbyshire","asCharacter":"Emily Nugentas Emily Nugent"},{"id":"nm3378080","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Heannau","asCharacter":"Peter Barlowas Peter Barlow"},{"id":"nm3261469","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Katie Heannau","asCharacter":"Susan Barlowas Susan Barlow"},{"id":"nm0011516","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Adamson","asCharacter":"Len Faircloughas Len Fairclough"},{"id":"nm0681093","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTY2YWRjYjgtYTkxYy00MzNlLWEzN2QtZDBiNmMxYjU1Y2IwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.6714_AL_.jpg","name":"Patricia Phoenix","asCharacter":"Elsie Tanneras Elsie Tanner"},{"id":"nm0141340","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Violet Carson","asCharacter":"Ena Sharplesas Ena Sharples"},{"id":"nm0817515","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Doris Speed","asCharacter":"Annie Walkeras Annie Walker"},{"id":"nm0550646","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Reginald Marsh","asCharacter":"Dave Smithas Dave Smith"},{"id":"nm0504060","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Arthur Leslie","asCharacter":"Jack Walkeras Jack Walker"},{"id":"nm0290197","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joan Francis","asCharacter":"Dot Greenhalghas Dot Greenhalgh"},{"id":"nm1534689","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Callen Angelo","asCharacter":"Gary Straussas Gary Strauss"},{"id":"nm0619440","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA5NzgxNDMyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc1MzUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Nagy","asCharacter":"Gregg Flintas Gregg Flint"},{"id":"nm0018495","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmY2OWEzYWEtN2FkZS00ZjZhLWI4M2UtMzhiNjhlOGM0ZTFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jean Alexander","asCharacter":"Hilda Ogdenas Hilda Ogden"},{"id":"nm0949192","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bernard Youens","asCharacter":"Stan Ogdenas Stan Ogden"},{"id":"nm0230282","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmI3ZWM2MTctOWNmNi00ZDQ0LTk2YWEtNDNjZWNlNWZhMDUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.4857_AL_.jpg","name":"Eric Dodson","asCharacter":"Reverend Jamesas Reverend James"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Granada Television","companyList":[{"id":"co0103289","name":"Granada Television"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"young adults,elderly people,teenager","keywordList":["young adults","elderly people","teenager"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0053494","seriesTitle":"Coronation Street","seriesFullTitle":"Coronation Street (TV Series 1960â€“ )","seriesYear":"1960","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"810","previousEpisodeId":"tt1060416","nextEpisodeId":"tt1060418"},"errorMessage":null}
