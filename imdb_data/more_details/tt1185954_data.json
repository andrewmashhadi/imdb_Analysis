They trace his e-mails to a pretty college co-ed who recently returned to live at home after having had an affair with one of her professors. She denies having anything to do with the man's death so they look into the possibility that a co-worker is the culprit. As for the investigation into his own wrongful conviction, Charlie learns something new about Jack Reese and identifies another member of group of 5 police officers that may have been behind framing him. Ted Early starts his new teaching position.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Holly Dale","directorList":[{"id":"nm0197700","name":"Holly Dale"}],"writers":"Rand Ravich, Marjorie David, Wendy Calhoun","writerList":[{"id":"nm0712444","name":"Rand Ravich"},{"id":"nm0202997","name":"Marjorie David"},{"id":"nm1618213","name":"Wendy Calhoun"}],"stars":"Damian Lewis, Sarah Shahi, Donal Logue","starList":[{"id":"nm0507073","name":"Damian Lewis"},{"id":"nm1083404","name":"Sarah Shahi"},{"id":"nm0006610","name":"Donal Logue"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0507073","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2OTcyMDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU3NTU5OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Damian Lewis","asCharacter":"Charlie Crewsas Charlie Crews"},{"id":"nm1083404","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0MzE2NTI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwMzMwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarah Shahi","asCharacter":"Dani Reeseas Dani Reese"},{"id":"nm0006610","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxNzI1NjQxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzI0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Donal Logue","asCharacter":"Captain Kevin Tidwellas Captain Kevin Tidwell"},{"id":"nm0035060","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGY2ZWI5ZDUtNzY0NS00ZWRkLWE0MmMtMWMzZGM3YzlhNTFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjgwMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Arkin","asCharacter":"Ted Earleyas Ted Earley"},{"id":"nm1308076","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzMDg2ODIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY1ODg3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jennifer Siebel Newsom","asCharacter":"Jennifer Conoveras Jennifer Conover"},{"id":"nm0729582","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWYxYmNlZTAtOTlkNC00MTdlLWIwOGUtZmRhZDdkNzM0OWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Victor Rivers","asCharacter":"Jack Reeseas Jack Reese"},{"id":"nm0052186","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODI2OTYyOTQ4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTM3MTUxNDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Banks","asCharacter":"Nathan Grayas Nathan Gray"},{"id":"nm1789336","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODRlZjA4OGYtMzUyZC00OGViLWI2YjYtODRlZDgxZjhkYjdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jessy Schram","asCharacter":"Rachel Seyboltas Rachel Seybolt"},{"id":"nm0703725","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTZkOGFhZDYtZjczYS00YzdkLTg5OTMtNjBjYTViNGQ4OWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM3MjMwMDk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maeve Quinlan","asCharacter":"Lynn Grayas Lynn Gray"},{"id":"nm1567202","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjViNjAyNDQtNWJhNC00MWUyLWEyYWQtMDliYTViNjljYzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1NTQ5ODA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kate Miner","asCharacter":"Bethany Grayas Bethany Gray"},{"id":"nm0812550","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU5NTA0ODU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMwODczMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alex Sol","asCharacter":"Rob Dowas Rob Dow"},{"id":"nm1872697","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTNmNTA1ZWMtYWY0OS00ZDRlLWEyNjEtMDNkOGM4MGE3NzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY2NjQ4MzA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gloria Garayua","asCharacter":"Rosaas Rosa"},{"id":"nm0789972","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWJlMWM2NzMtMjM3NS00NjdjLTk1ZTktMTM4YzhmNjdiN2ViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE4MzM1MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Sheila Shaw","asCharacter":"Widow Dunnas Widow Dunn"},{"id":"nm1196754","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzFlYjJjZDgtNDA3ZC00Yjg3LTgwM2QtNmM3OWQ2MmYwNmQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tyson Turrou","asCharacter":"Fleeras Fleer"},{"id":"nm1782490","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA5OTNiM2MtNDgwNC00NmIwLWI5NDItOTZiODJiMWZlNjJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3857_AL_.jpg","name":"John D.
