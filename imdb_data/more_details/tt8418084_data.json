The reaction of which man has been dispossessed can be replaced only by belief. Only belief in the world can reconnect man to what he sees and hears. The cinema must film, not the world, but belief in this world, our only link.\" The Cinema Club hears Deleuze's cry and aims to broaden the discourse of classic and contemporary works of cinema by applying new forms of criticism to the language of cinematic expression. It is no coincidence that the members of Cinema Club are deeply schooled in a classic tradition of cinematic legends. Take what Bazin said of cinema for instance, \"The photographer proceeds, via the intermediary of the lens, to a point where he literally takes a luminous imprint, a cast - [But] the cinema realizes the paradox of molding itself on the time of the object and of taking the imprint of its duration as well.\" Again, the Cinema Club could not agree more and was founded on Bazin's hope for a brighter vision of what cinema could and should be. All hail the new voice of cinema.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Cory Zacharia, Patrick Llaguno, Angel Princess","starList":[{"id":"nm3374584","name":"Cory Zacharia"},{"id":"nm3155507","name":"Patrick Llaguno"},{"id":"nm2217997","name":"Angel Princess"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3374584","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0ODc0ODI2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg5NjQ5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cory Zacharia","asCharacter":"Coryas Cory"},{"id":"nm3155507","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Patrick Llaguno","asCharacter":"Patrickas Patrick"},{"id":"nm2217997","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzUxYjRhMDQtYTAzNi00OTFlLTg3NWYtMjI2OGRkNzhmODAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk5MTc4NDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Angel Princess","asCharacter":"Angelas Angel"},{"id":"nm1227638","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQxNjcxMjAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcyOTMzNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Gioulakis","asCharacter":"Mike Gas Mike G"},{"id":"nm6845936","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Max Ciesynski","asCharacter":"Maxas Max"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Talk-Show","genreList":[{"key":"Talk-Show","value":"Talk-Show"}],"companies":"Small Form Films","companyList":[{"id":"co0249602","name":"Small Form Films"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"8.4","imDbRatingVotes":"25","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"All hail the new voice on cinema!","keywords":"cinema,film criticism,fellini,respect,love","keywordList":["cinema","film criticism","fellini","respect","love"],"similars":[{"id":"tt16959950","title":"Wunderkind","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTNkZDgzMDQtZjlhNy00ZWU5LThmODktNGNlZjhjNzZkMjdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY0MDgyOA@@._V1_Ratio0.7536_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":""},{"id":"tt1608285","title":"Littlerock","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyMjAxNzU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY3OTE5MDE@._V1_Ratio0.6860_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.0"},{"id":"tt4411466","title":"California Dreams","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmI2OTgxYjUtOGE3My00YzEyLWE0NTQtMzZkNTM3OGZlZTAxL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY0MDgyOA@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.4"},{"id":"tt10136624","title":"Unemployable","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTQ2NDAyZjUtMDQ2MC00NTU1LWI5YjctODg3MGNhZTQ2MjIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY0MDgyOA@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":""},{"id":"tt2670290","title":"Lake Los Angeles","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNDAxNTYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA5ODYxMDE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.7"},{"id":"tt0801819","title":"Analog Days","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3NDE2MDcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg2MzMzMQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.0"},{"id":"tt4411500","title":"Actor Martinez","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGZkYzA1ZTYtYjUxNy00ZjJlLWI5ZDQtZWM5OTJlYTJiYWQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg0ODE1ODE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"5.4"},{"id":"tt4663974","title":"Lancaster, CA","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU2OTE0NDA1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDk1Nzc4NTE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.1"},{"id":"tt8650826","title":"Fiction/Non-Fiction","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDY5NDI2ZWQtYjRjYi00NDMwLWI1NTgtY2MzN2YxZmJjZDRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY0MDgyOA@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.9"},{"id":"tt2582846","title":"The Fault in Our Stars","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTVkMTFiZWItOTFkOC00YTc3LWFhYzQtZTg3NzAxZjJlNTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NzE3OTE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.7"}],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Jan Bezouska, Mike Ott","creatorList":[{"id":"nm0080110","name":"Jan Bezouska"},{"id":"nm0653056","name":"Mike Ott"}],"seasons":["1","2"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
