1) start with the binary reg tree model and how it works.
2) show the single reg tree
3) talk about pruning it and describe why we would prune it (to reduce overfitting, etc.)
4) mention the benefits of the random forest instead (bootstrapping and low correlated trees)
5) discuss and display the nice graphics and results from random forest
6) display the k-fold cv errors and the predictive accuracy
7) consider applying to different time intervals, genres, etc. and comparing the results
