Jack, in town to meet someone, is a chronic drinker and driver, he still doing so despite having his license temporarily suspended. Teens Mark, Eddie, and Tim are out for a joyride in Mark's van, they generally causing havoc all in the name of having fun, that is until something goes wrong. Frank, out for a walk with his dog, stumbles across something which makes him jump to a conclusion about his daughter, to whom he is both overprotective and overly trusting. Duffy, who works as a clerk at Lloyd's EZZZ Stop convenience store, goes to the store just as it is closing to ask his friend, the clerk on duty, Buzzy, for a favor, which may be difficult for her to grant based on her own needs, and Cheri is trying to get a few hundred dollars for an abortion from the purported \"fathers\", while in reality, she has another plan in mind. All their actions make for a busy night for the first responders on-duty, including Officer Hannagan, and paramedics Leon and Kevin.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 8
