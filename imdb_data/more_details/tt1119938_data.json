Someone has kidnapped the son of Adam Kondos (Phil Reisen), the District Attorney who successfully prosecuted Crowe for murdering a family. Now the kidnapper is threatening to kill the young boy if Crowe doesn't receive a stay of execution. The Feds enlist Danny to impersonate a death row priest, in order to try to get Crowe to end his life by doing the right thing and reveal the kidnapper's location. Can Danny get the information he needs in time to prevent a second life from ending? The kids watch the TV as the drama unfolds and discuss the \"merits\" of executions. The kidnapper puts a photo of the boy on a news van outside the prison-meaning the kidnapper isn't too far away from the prison. Barbara goes undercover a news reporter to see if she can get any information on the kidnapper. Henry figures out that Danny is not a real priest. They are not getting anywhere and the governor will not stay the execution. As the time ticks away, Danny desperately tries to get Henry to talk.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Sanford Bookstaver","directorList":[{"id":"nm0095424","name":"Sanford Bookstaver"}],"writers":"Michael Angeli","writerList":[{"id":"nm0029556","name":"Michael Angeli"}],"stars":"Peter Dobson, Melora Hardin, Cameron Richardson","starList":[{"id":"nm0229930","name":"Peter Dobson"},{"id":"nm0002124","name":"Melora Hardin"},{"id":"nm0724460","name":"Cameron Richardson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0229930","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGU5Nzc3N2MtNzFjNC00YzFjLWI5YjQtOTJhOWQzOTQzOTRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgyMTYxOTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Dobson","asCharacter":"Danny Arnoas Danny Arno"},{"id":"nm0002124","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcyNzAzODk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEyNTE2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Melora Hardin","asCharacter":"Barbara Arnoas Barbara Arno"},{"id":"nm0724460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczODgwODc0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk3MjAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cameron Richardson","asCharacter":"Celeste Arnoas Celeste Arno"},{"id":"nm0681450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Antoinette Picatto","asCharacter":"Ruby Arnoas Ruby Arno"},{"id":"nm0029400","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjliNTliMDQtMzE5ZC00OTNmLWE3ZTItYTFhOWRhM2JkY2I1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Angarano","asCharacter":"Chance Arnoas Chance Arno"},{"id":"nm0026627","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4OTE4NjU4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA3MjEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dion Anderson","asCharacter":"Reverendas Reverend"},{"id":"nm0081560","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDkyOWI4ZDgtNzRlNS00ZWUwLWFhODgtZjkwYzNiMzcyYTY5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ramon Bieri","asCharacter":"Mr. Croweas Mr. Crowe"},{"id":"nm0114931","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTJjOWQ2ZjctZmYxOS00MzJlLTg1NDgtNTdhNWZlMTI5Mzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIxMjUyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Wren T.
