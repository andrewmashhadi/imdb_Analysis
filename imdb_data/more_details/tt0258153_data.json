Forced to think fast, the producer decides to digitally create an actress \"Simone\" to sub for the star--the first totally believable synthetic actress. The \"actress\" becomes an overnight sensation, with a major singing career as well, and everyone thinks she's a real person. However, as Simone's fame skyrockets, he cannot bear to admit his fraud to himself or the world.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"Andrew
