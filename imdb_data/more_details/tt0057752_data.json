Duke, Frankie, Lester, and Larry were some of Gomer's pals and fellow enlisted men at Camp Henderson, and Lou Anne Poovie was his sometime girlfriend.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jim Nabors, Frank Sutton, Ronnie Schell","starList":[{"id":"nm0001561","name":"Jim Nabors"},{"id":"nm0840308","name":"Frank Sutton"},{"id":"nm0770742","name":"Ronnie Schell"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001561","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ2MTEyNjMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODE0MzQ2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Nabors","asCharacter":"Pvt.
