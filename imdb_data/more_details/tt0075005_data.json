They are happily married and he is the US Ambassador to Great Britain, but they want nothing more than to have children. When Katharine has a stillborn child, Robert is approached by a priest at the hospital who suggests that they take a healthy newborn whose mother has just died in childbirth. Without telling his wife he agrees. After relocating to London, strange events - and the ominous warnings of a priest - lead him to believe that the child he took from that Italian hospital is evil incarnate.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 5 wins & 8 nominations total","directors":"Richard Donner","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001149","name":"Richard
