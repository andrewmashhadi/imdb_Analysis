Ignoring the childish \"campfire\" stories heard about the area, they continue with their mission and come across the bloody remains of the Special Ops Squad, and a fierce howling is pitching the night sky... With two mortally wounded men, they make an escape, running into a zoologist by the name of Megan - who knows exactly what hunts them. What began as what they thought was a training mission turns into a battle for their lives against the most unlikely enemies they would have expected - werewolves.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 7 nominations","directors":"Neil Marshall","directorList":[{"id":"nm0551076","name":"Neil Marshall"}],"writers":"Neil
