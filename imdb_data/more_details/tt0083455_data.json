Dick is a how-to book writer, who eventually becomes a local television celebrity as host of \"Vermont Today\". George Utley (Tom Poston) is the handyman at the inn, and Leslie Vanderkellen (Jennifer Holmes) is the maid, with ambitions of being an Olympic Ski champion; she is later replaced by her cousin Stephanie (Julia Duffy), an heiress who hates her job. Her boyfriend is Dick's yuppie television producer, Michael Harris (Peter Scolari). There are many other quirky characters in this fictional little town, including Dick's neighbors Larry (William Sanderson), Darryl (Tony Papenfuss), and Darryl (John Voldstad)...three brothers who buy the Minuteman Café from Kirk Devane (Steven Kampmann). Besides sharing a name, Darryl and Darryl never speak, until the final episode.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 25 Primetime Emmys, 6 wins & 43 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Bob Newhart, Mary Frann, Tom Poston","starList":[{"id":"nm0627878","name":"Bob Newhart"},{"id":"nm0291710","name":"Mary Frann"},{"id":"nm0692976","name":"Tom Poston"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0627878","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk5MDE5NDcxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTAxOTkwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Newhart","asCharacter":"Dick Loudonas Dick Loudon…"},{"id":"nm0291710","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2ZkMmVkNGMtYjcyOS00YjkzLWI5ODUtMjUwNjllYTVjZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Frann","asCharacter":"Joanna Loudonas Joanna Loudon"},{"id":"nm0692976","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwMzUxMjkzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUyMjky._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Poston","asCharacter":"George Utleyas George Utley"},{"id":"nm0240564","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWUxNjZiZDUtNjkwNi00MmJhLWFkYjUtOTQ5YjZkOWEwNjM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0NTczOTM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Julia Duffy","asCharacter":"Stephanie Vanderkellenas Stephanie Vanderkellen"},{"id":"nm0778642","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4OTk2MTkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEwNzYzMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Scolari","asCharacter":"Michael Harrisas Michael Harris"},{"id":"nm0761836","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI0NjIxMjMwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1NzgzOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Sanderson","asCharacter":"Larryas Larry"},{"id":"nm0660425","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tony Papenfuss","asCharacter":"First Darrylas First Darryl…"},{"id":"nm0901390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWE1ZDlmMjYtYTdkZC00YTgxLTg5NDctYjRlZGJmMjU3ZGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk0NTg0MDA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Voldstad","asCharacter":"Second Darrylas Second Darryl…"},{"id":"nm0436950","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steven Kampmann","asCharacter":"Kirk Devaneas Kirk Devane"},{"id":"nm0487140","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU4OTU3Mjc2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgwMDY2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"William Lanteau","asCharacter":"Chester Wanamakeras Chester Wanamaker"},{"id":"nm0384718","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWRmOTljZmUtOTJjNC00ZWY5LTk0ZjUtNDRlMzllOGRjN2YwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thomas Hill","asCharacter":"Jim Dixonas Jim Dixon"},{"id":"nm0391875","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jennifer Holmes","asCharacter":"Leslie Vanderkellenas Leslie Vanderkellen"},{"id":"nm0839881","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzODgxOTQyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY1NTExMw@@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Todd Susman","asCharacter":"Officer Shifflettas Officer Shifflett"},{"id":"nm0544382","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTgzMzgwMTAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA4MDIyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Ralph Manza","asCharacter":"Budas Bud"},{"id":"nm0234731","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3MzQzNTU5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzU2MDgy._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Doucette","asCharacter":"Harley Estinas Harley Estin"},{"id":"nm0032395","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1MDczNzgwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcyMDA1NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fred Applegate","asCharacter":"J.J.
