He always seems to have his hands full: He's having affairs with most of his waitresses, he's keeping his wife happy, he's trying to please the German soldiers who frequent his café, and he's running a major underground operation for the Resistance. Quite often, the Germans' incompetence itself is what nearly lands René and his cohorts in hot water; they are not helped either by the locals, who are dreadfully keen to get rid of the Germans, but their blatant and theatrical attempts at espionage and secrecy often create problems that René must solve quickly.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 5 BAFTA Awards, 1 win & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Gorden Kaye, Carmen Silvera, Vicki Michelle","starList":[{"id":"nm0443313","name":"Gorden Kaye"},{"id":"nm0798819","name":"Carmen Silvera"},{"id":"nm0585053","name":"Vicki Michelle"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0443313","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIwNTU3NDkwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNTUyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gorden Kaye","asCharacter":"René Artoisas René Artois"},{"id":"nm0798819","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjc5ZDFjMGQtY2ZhMi00MTRmLWFjNzktYTBhMTdhN2Y3NWMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Carmen Silvera","asCharacter":"Edith Artoisas Edith Artois"},{"id":"nm0585053","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA5NzIwMzAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk4MzAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vicki Michelle","asCharacter":"Yvette Carte-Blancheas Yvette Carte-Blanche"},{"id":"nm0549424","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjc5NDg3NzM3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcyMDMxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Marner","asCharacter":"Colonel Kurt von Strohmas Colonel Kurt von Strohm"},{"id":"nm0366983","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGQ1YWI0NDctZmQxYi00NjNkLWE4NmUtYTY0YjZjMzBiYTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kim Hartman","asCharacter":"Private Helga Geerhartas Private Helga Geerhart…"},{"id":"nm0801838","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyMzI5MjQ4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA0NDkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Guy Siner","asCharacter":"Lieutenant Hubert Gruberas Lieutenant Hubert Gruber"},{"id":"nm0177457","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjk0NWQ2ZGYtM2YzNC00ZmI0LWEyYzItYzY1ZDNmY2JjZjU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgxOTIzNzk@._V1_Ratio1.0429_AL_.jpg","name":"Kirsten Cooke","asCharacter":"Michelle Duboisas Michelle Dubois"},{"id":"nm0317159","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc0MTUzNjA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkzMTUzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Gibson","asCharacter":"Herr Otto Flickas Herr Otto Flick"},{"id":"nm0384641","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rose Hill","asCharacter":"Madame Fannyas Madame Fanny"},{"id":"nm0098284","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTdjNDQwZWEtMTdlOS00ODlhLTkzMmEtZTEwYzdiOTAyMmJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAwNTA3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Arthur Bostrom","asCharacter":"Officer Crabtreeas Officer Crabtree"},{"id":"nm0172412","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTExMzk1NjI5MDReQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDQ4MDE5Njcx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John D.
