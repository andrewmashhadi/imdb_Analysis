They were pursued by a band of mutants. All but one of their escape ships was destroyed. Only a small group of Thunderans (Thundercats) remained. With only half engine power, the group, which was led by Jaga, had to set a course for the nearest planet. Jaga commanded their ship while the other 7 were in their stasis tubes. Jaga died on their journey to Third Earth and their ship crashed there. Soon they made friends with various groups in the area and they designed a fortress. Mumm-Ra the centuries-old embodiment of evil, along with the mutants that destroyed the rest of the Thunderans are a constant threat. But Lion-O, the new leader of the Thundercats, with his weapon the \"Sword of Omens\" will help the Thundercats to have a standing chance.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Bob McFadden, Larry Kenney, Earl Hammond","starList":[{"id":"nm0568657","name":"Bob McFadden"},{"id":"nm0448489","name":"Larry Kenney"},{"id":"nm0358679","name":"Earl Hammond"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0568657","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bob McFadden","asCharacter":"Snarfas Snarf…"},{"id":"nm0448489","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Larry Kenney","asCharacter":"Lion-Oas Lion-O…"},{"id":"nm0358679","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Earl Hammond","asCharacter":"Mumm-Raas Mumm-Ra…"},{"id":"nm0513860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjBlMWEwMzEtN2QxZi00YjJmLTg1NTQtNTEyODY4NDIyMjk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTY4NDM3MTM@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lynne Lipton","asCharacter":"Cheetaraas Cheetara…"},{"id":"nm0405165","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzMDcyNjg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODI1NjEyNDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Earle Hyman","asCharacter":"Panthroas Panthro…"},{"id":"nm2562106","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Newman","asCharacter":"Tygraas Tygra…"},{"id":"nm0710699","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gerrianne Raphael","asCharacter":"Pumyraas Pumyra…"},{"id":"nm0695831","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Doug Preis","asCharacter":"Alluroas Alluro"},{"id":"nm0874249","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Víctor Trujillo","asCharacter":"Jackalmanas Jackalman"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"Rankin/Bass Productions, Telepictures Corporation, Lorimar Telepictures","companyList":[{"id":"co0093733","name":"Rankin/Bass Productions"},{"id":"co0070202","name":"Telepictures Corporation"},{"id":"co0119345","name":"Lorimar Telepictures"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-Y7","imDbRating":"7.9","imDbRatingVotes":"17617","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"1980s,superhero,male protagonist,male antagonist,timeframe 1980s","keywordList":["1980s","superhero","male protagonist","male antagonist","timeframe 1980s"],"similars":[{"id":"tt0126158","title":"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODgyYzRhNzAtMTJlNC00OTM0LWI3M2ItNzZjYzYxZmJiOWIyL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxNjc5NjY@._V1_Ratio0.6860_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.5"},{"id":"tt1666278","title":"Thundercats","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2NlNjBmMjYtNGE5MC00N2ExLWFlZmItZGUzNzBkZTdkM2QwL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxNjc5NjY@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.8"},{"id":"tt0090520","title":"Silverhawks","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDgwOTg0NDUtMTgzNC00MGI3LThjMDktOGViYWRlMWI1NmI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_Ratio0.7536_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.3"},{"id":"tt0086817","title":"The Transformers","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjZkN2E5MDMtM2U1ZS00MGE2LTg1NzktYzZhYmVkNmJkYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjExODE1MDc@._V1_Ratio0.7150_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.0"},{"id":"tt0088563","title":"MASK","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjFhYzc4MTItYWNjNi00NzhjLThlZTEtZmU5Mzg5MWE3YjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjExODE1MDc@._V1_Ratio0.7150_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.2"},{"id":"tt0086824","title":"Voltron: Defender of the Universe","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDUyNGFiM2QtMzFkMC00YjhjLTk3NjktYmMwZDY1Njg2OTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_Ratio0.7053_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.9"},{"id":"tt0127471","title":"BraveStarr","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTIwNzE4YzItNzZjYy00ZGYxLWIyZWYtZDU2MzlmZGVkYTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_Ratio0.7150_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.0"},{"id":"tt1223895","title":"Thundercats Ho!
