The first episode titled Momotaro, tells Super Mario's version of a popular Japanese fairy tale about Momotaro or \"Peach Boy\". Once upon a time, on a very small planet, a nice elderly couple of humanoid turtles had a beautiful human daughter named Princess Peach. One day, evil space pirate King Koopa kidnaps her and locks her up in a dungeon until she agrees to marry him. Her parents grow in desperation until one night a shooting star shoots across the sky and a giant peach appears in front of them. It opens up and they find a human child with a mustache inside. They name him Mario and take care of him. When he grows up, he finds out about their kidnapped daughter and goes to save Princess Peach. Others who hate Koopa join him along the way. In the second episode titled Dwarf, and based on a popular Japanese folk tale called Issun-boshi or \"One-Inch Boy\", a tale somewhat similar to Tom Thumb, a childless couple wishes for a baby. A shooting star brings them a tiny child with a mustache whom they name Mario. He grows up to be the size of a thumb. That's when young Mario starts dreaming about seeing the world, so he travels to the nearby metropolis where he is rescued from a river by lovely normal-sized Princess Peach just as notorious pirate King Koopa arrives to ask her to marry him again - a request she constantly refuses to give into. In Snow White, the third and final tale, wicked Queen Koopa is obsessed with being the most beautiful in the world. One day, her mirror tells her that Princess Peach from the neighboring kingdom is the fairest now. The queen sends her evil minions the Koopalings to take care of her. That's when heroic Super Mario runs into them, saves Princess Peach and hides her with his friends - the Toads, a band of friendly tiny mushroom-people.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Tôru Furuya, Naoki Tatsuta, Toshiko Sawada","starList":[{"id":"nm0299228","name":"Tôru Furuya"},{"id":"nm0851311","name":"Naoki Tatsuta"},{"id":"nm0767991","name":"Toshiko Sawada"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0299228","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGJhZTFkYjAtNjAzNS00OTgwLWI3NTYtZjcxM2RjNzdlMTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tôru Furuya","asCharacter":"Marioas Mario"},{"id":"nm0851311","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjA2ZjM3ZTMtNGZiMS00M2E2LWI1NjQtYTEzOGM5NTUzZDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Naoki Tatsuta","asCharacter":"Gabon (Spike)as Gabon (Spike)"},{"id":"nm0767991","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDgxY2UxYTYtOWY5Ni00MzJkLWE5ZDItOWNiYmQ0MWVhNmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Toshiko Sawada","asCharacter":"Narratoras Narrator"},{"id":"nm0766493","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Masaharu Satô","asCharacter":"Iggy Koopaas Iggy Koopa"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Short, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"Nintendo, Studio Junio","companyList":[{"id":"co0002481","name":"Nintendo"},{"id":"co0035892","name":"Studio Junio"}],"countries":"Japan","countryList":[{"key":"Japan","value":"Japan"}],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":"TV-Y7-FV","imDbRating":"5.5","imDbRatingVotes":"26","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"outer space,anime adaptation,luigi mario character,super mario character,fairy tale","keywordList":["outer space","anime adaptation","luigi mario character","super mario character","fairy tale"],"similars":[{"id":"tt0469611","title":"Super Mario Brothers: Great Mission to Rescue Princess Peach","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmQ4NjZhY2YtNzZjOS00ZDAyLThlNjktYzdiNmM2ODczMzdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA4NzMyNDcw._V1_Ratio0.7150_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"5.6"},{"id":"tt8922116","title":"Super Mario World: Mario & Yoshi's Adventure Land","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2Q1YTYyNjMtMDU3OC00NDNkLWExYjMtNTg2N2U4OTUzMWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzMwOTY2NTI@._V1_Ratio0.7150_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.4"}],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Juri Yagi","creatorList":[{"id":"nm6091828","name":"Juri Yagi"}],"seasons":["1"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
