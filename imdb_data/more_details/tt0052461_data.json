Dennis Mitchell was a loveable young boy, dressed in overalls and carrying a slingshot in his pocket. Everywhere he went, Dennis' wide-eyed curiosity, well-meaning attempts to help out, and his simply being a normal, red-blooded American boy growing up always seemed to lead to trouble. Usually on the receiving end was Dennis' next-door neighbor, retired business machine salesman George Wilson. Dennis worshiped Mr. Wilson, but he usually displayed a less-than-cordial attitude around the young lad. Mr. Wilson's wife, Martha, adored Dennis and saw him as a surrogate grandson (since the Wilsons never had any children). Dennis' long-suffering parents were Henry (an engineer) and Alice (a stay-at-home mother). Episodes revolved around Dennis' adventures and the trouble that usually followed. Also involved in the fun were Dennis' friends Tommy, Margaret, and Seymour. During the final year of the show, Mr. Wilson's brother, John, moved in after George and Martha left the neighborhood (due to the death of Joseph Kearns). The live-action \"Dennis the Menace\" ran for years in syndication; an animated series showed up in the 1980s.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Herbert Anderson, Jay North, Gloria Henry","starList":[{"id":"nm0026802","name":"Herbert Anderson"},{"id":"nm0636020","name":"Jay North"},{"id":"nm0377839","name":"Gloria Henry"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0026802","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzOTAzNTYyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ0NjUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Herbert Anderson","asCharacter":"Henry Mitchellas Henry Mitchell"},{"id":"nm0636020","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTMwNzZiOGYtYmZmNi00MjIzLTgxZGUtY2Y3NWJhZDVhM2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jay North","asCharacter":"Dennis Mitchellas Dennis Mitchell"},{"id":"nm0377839","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTgxMzEwNTc4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE5MDUwMzE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gloria Henry","asCharacter":"Alice Mitchellas Alice Mitchell"},{"id":"nm0095651","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyNzczMzU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIxNjcwMzE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Booth","asCharacter":"Tommy Andersonas Tommy Anderson"},{"id":"nm0444012","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0Njc4NzU1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTI2MjU5MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Joseph Kearns","asCharacter":"George Wilsonas George Wilson"},{"id":"nm0276058","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2NzM0MTc0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2NjUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Sylvia Field","asCharacter":"Martha Wilsonas Martha Wilson"},{"id":"nm0330198","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyMDAzMDMyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc2NjUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Gale Gordon","asCharacter":"John Wilsonas John Wilson"},{"id":"nm0751223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI0MTE0MDA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA0NjUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeannie Russell","asCharacter":"Margaret Wadeas Margaret Wade…"},{"id":"nm0781504","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0ODU1MTUxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg2NjUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Sara Seegar","asCharacter":"Eloise Wilsonas Eloise Wilson…"},{"id":"nm0685961","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert John Pittman","asCharacter":"Seymouras Seymour…"},{"id":"nm0149204","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTgzZDA4MmYtZTBiMi00Y2E5LTk5MzgtYjdkM2M0N2ViMDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George Cisar","asCharacter":"Sgt.
