It seems that heathenistic jungle rituals are not so easily forgotten, however, as Nathan proceeds to show a modern world the power hidden in ancient Amazon rites of starvation, deprivation, and cannibalism. Caught in Nathan's web of murder and carnage is Aimee; an all-American college freshmen suddenly faced with the grim reality of survival in a nightmare controlled by this brilliant, yet deranged killer. How far will she go to stay alive, trapped in his dungeon with her best friend and room mate, Tara? Starvation can be a powerful tool... where does friendship stand in matters of life and death? Follow this bizarre and terrifying tale, as Nathan's story intertwines with the lives of police officer's Carver and Ryan, and we learn the true power of the Cobeus rituals. Nathan is hungry, and the world is his dining table. But are we truly ready for dinner to be served?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Erick Adam","directorList":[{"id":"nm2446146","name":"Erick Adam"}],"writers":"Erick Adam","writerList":[{"id":"nm2446146","name":"Erick Adam"}],"stars":"Josef Niznik, Ronni Lea, Alastair Bayardo","starList":[{"id":"nm3680501","name":"Josef Niznik"},{"id":"nm3642390","name":"Ronni Lea"},{"id":"nm3036514","name":"Alastair Bayardo"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3680501","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Josef Niznik","asCharacter":"Nathan Haswellas Nathan Haswell"},{"id":"nm3642390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ronni Lea","asCharacter":"Aimeeas Aimee"},{"id":"nm3036514","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM0NDEzNTUwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzNzY4OTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alastair Bayardo","asCharacter":"Officer Ryanas Officer Ryan"},{"id":"nm3676272","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kirk Thompson","asCharacter":"Officer Carveras Officer Carver"},{"id":"nm3676630","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kelley Janell Hall","asCharacter":"Terraas Terra"},{"id":"nm3504400","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTkyMDAwZmEtOTk1ZC00YmVlLTg5ZmUtZmUxMTkyMzBkZGZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Manuel Domenech","asCharacter":"Evanas Evan"},{"id":"nm3680580","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Helen Lipton","asCharacter":"Nancy Haswellas Nancy Haswell"},{"id":"nm3188472","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Donald Miller","asCharacter":"Dr. Barnumas Dr. Barnum"},{"id":"nm3158955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Antoinette Correia","asCharacter":"Saraas Sara"},{"id":"nm3681774","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jessica Rae Dixon","asCharacter":"Mia Roseas Mia Rose"},{"id":"nm3681554","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Katherine Hart","asCharacter":"Kaylaas Kayla"},{"id":"nm3676519","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Courtney Bray","asCharacter":"Hollyas Holly"},{"id":"nm2449288","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jonathon Hart","asCharacter":"Brianas Brian"},{"id":"nm3676487","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ali Taheri","asCharacter":"Rezaas Reza"},{"id":"nm3681891","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rob Darren","asCharacter":"Tied Up Manas Tied Up Man"},{"id":"nm3936406","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Collins","asCharacter":"Aaron Sidesas Aaron Sides"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Horror, Thriller","genreList":[{"key":"Horror","value":"Horror"},{"key":"Thriller","value":"Thriller"}],"companies":"Scared-E-Cat Pictures","companyList":[{"id":"co0288527","name":"Scared-E-Cat Pictures"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"5.6","imDbRatingVotes":"39","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"Dinner Is Served...","keywords":"police,murder,death,cannibalism,violence","keywordList":["police","murder","death","cannibalism","violence"],"similars":[{"id":"tt4282670","title":"Feast","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg5MTQwNTMzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgyNjQyNzE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"8.1"},{"id":"tt0426459","title":"Feast","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI0MzI5MTY1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU4MjYzMQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.2"}],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
