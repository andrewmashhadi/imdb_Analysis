This is the story of Nilton and Fernando, who work as pilots in Amazonia, a film about flying as a dream and a passion, a job and a fate. Nilton and Fernando live this reality, on a tightrope between a longing for freedom from Earth's gravity and the attraction of flying as a way to make a living in Amazonia. Two first-class flyers who can take off from land or water, hoboes of the air. Their paths cross for a week when they join forces as the pilot and copilot of a Cessna Centurion and become the victims of a dramatic, do-or-die kidnapping attempt.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Herbert Brödl","directorList":[{"id":"nm0117626","name":"Herbert Brödl"}],"writers":"Herbert Brödl","writerList":[{"id":"nm0117626","name":"Herbert Brödl"}],"stars":"Fernando Alves Pinto, Nilton Bicudo","starList":[{"id":"nm0684654","name":"Fernando Alves Pinto"},{"id":"nm0081099","name":"Nilton Bicudo"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0684654","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Fernando Alves Pinto","asCharacter":"Fernandoas Fernando"},{"id":"nm0081099","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nilton Bicudo","asCharacter":"Niltonas Nilton"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion","companyList":[{"id":"co0085648","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion"}],"countries":"Austria","countryList":[{"key":"Austria","value":"Austria"}],"languages":"Portuguese","languageList":[{"key":"Portuguese","value":"Portuguese"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"7.2","imDbRatingVotes":"9","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$15,229"},"tagline":null,"keywords":"one word title","keywordList":["one word title"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
