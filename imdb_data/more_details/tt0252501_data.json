Memories of life at age eleven floods back as it was a magical time that changed his life. Three eleven-year-old children, Bobby Garfield (Anton Yelchin), Carol Gerber (Mika Boorem), and John \"Sully\" Sullivan (Will Rothhaar), share their lives. Carol and Bobby have a special affection for one another including sharing a kiss \"by which all others will be measured.\" Bobby lives with his mother, Liz (Hope Davis), a bitter, vain woman who looks for pleasures for herself without sharing much with her son. Into their lives comes a mysterious new boarder, Ted Brautigan (Sir Anthony Hopkins), who befriends the boy, but generates distrust from the mother. As time passes, the man and boy share confidences, and special powers are revealed. The man warns the boy to be on the lookout for the \"Low Men in Yellow Coats\" who are seeking him. The two share a summer's adventures and come to love one another before the inevitable happens. A confrontation with a school bully also changes everyone.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 8 nominations","directors":"Scott Hicks","directorList":[{"id":"nm0382956","name":"Scott Hicks"}],"writers":"Stephen King, William Goldman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000175","name":"Stephen King"},{"id":"nm0001279","name":"William Goldman"}],"stars":"Anthony Hopkins, Anton Yelchin, Hope Davis","starList":[{"id":"nm0000164","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"id":"nm0947338","name":"Anton Yelchin"},{"id":"nm0204706","name":"Hope Davis"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000164","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg5ODk1NTc5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjAwOTI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anthony Hopkins","asCharacter":"Ted Brautiganas Ted Brautigan"},{"id":"nm0947338","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzQ5ODE1OTE5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQwMjExNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anton Yelchin","asCharacter":"Bobby Garfieldas Bobby Garfield"},{"id":"nm0204706","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTM4Mjk5MjAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ3MTk3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hope Davis","asCharacter":"Liz Garfieldas Liz Garfield"},{"id":"nm0095561","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTM2N2FlNzktNDgwZi00NDM4LWJiOGUtM2ZkYTI2OGYxYWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAwMDUxMDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mika Boorem","asCharacter":"Carol Gerberas Carol Gerber"},{"id":"nm0001556","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwNjUzOTE1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU4NDQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Morse","asCharacter":"Adult Bobby Garfieldas Adult Bobby Garfield"},{"id":"nm0876138","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MzEwNDUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE1MDAzOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alan Tudyk","asCharacter":"Monte Manas Monte Man"},{"id":"nm0101005","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTNkZDdjNGQtYWJjYi00ZjY4LTg0OTMtOWNkZjZjMjk5YzQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODQxMzk1NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Bower","asCharacter":"Len Filesas Len Files"},{"id":"nm0922927","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNDIyMjE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk4NzY5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Celia Weston","asCharacter":"Alana Filesas Alana Files"},{"id":"nm0480775","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI2OTY5NzE5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk3NjgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam LeFevre","asCharacter":"Don Bidermanas Don Biderman"},{"id":"nm0745194","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1OTExMDgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYzNjUxNTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Will Rothhaar","asCharacter":"John Sullivanas John Sullivan"},{"id":"nm0717562","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA3ODIxMDI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQ2MjIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.4286_AL_.jpg","name":"Timothy Reifsnyder","asCharacter":"Harry Doolinas Harry Doolin"},{"id":"nm0640055","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0ODQ1NDI0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQxMTQyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Deirdre O'Connell","asCharacter":"Mrs. Gerberas Mrs. Gerber"},{"id":"nm0064777","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Terry Beaver","asCharacter":"Mr. Oliveras Mr. Oliver"},{"id":"nm1125331","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joe Blankenship","asCharacter":"Richie O'Rourkeas Richie O'Rourke"},{"id":"nm1062251","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5ZmIyN2QtZjQ3My00MmFlLWI3ZGEtMDVmYmI4MzdmZWYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODYwNTE1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brett Fleisher","asCharacter":"Willie Shearmanas Willie Shearman"},{"id":"nm1126088","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joel F.
