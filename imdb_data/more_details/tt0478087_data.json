Wanting a scholarship to transfer to Harvard School of Medicine with the desire to become a doctor, Ben learns that he cannot afford the $300,000 for the four to five years of schooling as he comes from a poor, working-class background. But one evening, Ben is introduced by his unorthodox math professor Micky Rosa into a small but secretive club of five. Students Jill, Choi, Kianna, and Fisher, who are being trained by Professor Rosa of the skill of card counting at blackjack. Intrigued by the desire to make money, Ben joins his new friends on secret weekend trips to Las Vegas where, using their skills of code talk and hand signals, they have Ben make hundreds of thousands of dollars in winning blackjack at casino after casino. Ben only wants to make enough money for the tuition to Harvard and then back out. But as fellow card counter, Jill Taylor, predicts, Ben becomes corrupted by greed and his arrogance at winning which lets his feelings get in the way, and it also puts Professor Rosa, as well as the group, on the radar of a brutal casino security enforcer, named Cole Williams, who holds a personal grudge of some kind against Rosa which threatens to undo everything the students have learned and earned.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 5 nominations","directors":"Robert Luketic","directorList":[{"id":"nm0525659","name":"Robert Luketic"}],"writers":"Peter Steinfeld, Allan Loeb, Ben Mezrich","writerList":[{"id":"nm13204541","name":"Peter Steinfeld"},{"id":"nm1615610","name":"Allan Loeb"},{"id":"nm0583826","name":"Ben Mezrich"}],"stars":"Jim Sturgess, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey","starList":[{"id":"nm0836343","name":"Jim Sturgess"},{"id":"nm0098378","name":"Kate Bosworth"},{"id":"nm0000228","name":"Kevin Spacey"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0836343","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDU0NTE0NDYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc2MDI3Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Sturgess","asCharacter":"Benas Ben"},{"id":"nm0098378","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM4NTAwNDA0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk3MTg1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kate Bosworth","asCharacter":"Jillas Jill"},{"id":"nm0000228","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1NzMyODc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE2MzA1NDM@._V1_Ratio1.2286_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Spacey","asCharacter":"Micky Rosaas Micky Rosa"},{"id":"nm1683094","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3MzkxMzAwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQ1MTY3NzE@._V1_Ratio1.4000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aaron Yoo","asCharacter":"Choias Choi"},{"id":"nm0487594","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTRlMmZmNzktZWRiMi00YWU3LWIxMmItMmNhOTRiOWEwZjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.1857_AL_.jpg","name":"Liza Lapira","asCharacter":"Kiannaas Kianna"},{"id":"nm0686009","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGRlMWJmODUtMjNiZC00ODUwLTk4MWYtMTViZGM2NWEwYTI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTAyMDgxODQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jacob Pitts","asCharacter":"Fisheras Fisher"},{"id":"nm0000401","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0NjczNDc1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDU0Mjg1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Laurence Fishburne","asCharacter":"Cole Williamsas Cole Williams"},{"id":"nm0569079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxMzU5NDU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDczNjQ3NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack McGee","asCharacter":"Terryas Terry"},{"id":"nm1265802","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzU0MDIxYzktNmZiZC00ODcwLWIyYWMtNzI3MjhlMTA2MzhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Gad","asCharacter":"Milesas Miles"},{"id":"nm1758979","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MDM2MDY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjExODky._V1_Ratio1.0143_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Golzari","asCharacter":"Camas Cam"},{"id":"nm0136962","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTdmNzA4YjUtN2Y1MS00NzQzLTk3NzAtNGFjMzNmNzQxNzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ2ODYzNzY@._V1_Ratio1.8857_AL_.jpg","name":"Helen Carey","asCharacter":"Ellen Campbellas Ellen Campbell"},{"id":"nm0319636","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDdlYTMzMTctMjYwNS00NzQ2LTlkZjItMThlYmJkNjZmZjhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio2.0143_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Gilpin","asCharacter":"Bob Phillipsas Bob Phillips"},{"id":"nm2950920","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Donna Lows","asCharacter":"Planet Hollywood Dealeras Planet Hollywood Dealer"},{"id":"nm2950960","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Butch Williams","asCharacter":"Planet Hollywood Dealeras Planet Hollywood Dealer"},{"id":"nm2951275","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jeff Ma","asCharacter":"Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeffas Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeff"},{"id":"nm0666564","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDI2ODYxMTk0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg1NjAxNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frank Patton III","asCharacter":"Planet Hollywood Floor Manageras Planet Hollywood Floor Manager"},{"id":"nm2950872","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steven Richard Vezina","asCharacter":"Red Rock Dealeras Red Rock Dealer"},{"id":"nm2951332","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chaska T.
