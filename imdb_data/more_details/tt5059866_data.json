At school, Umaru appears to be the ideal student with good looks, top grades, and a lot of talent. Once she gets home, however, she reverts into a layabout who spends her time lying around, playing video games, and constantly depending on her older brother, much to his dismay. Over the course of the series, Umaru's alternative personalities help her become friends with her female classmates Kirie Motoba, who has a reputation of glaring at people; and Sylphynford Tachibana, a competitive school rival; both of whom turn out to be little sisters of Taihei's coworkers.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Aimi Tanaka, Akari Kageyama, Emily Neves","starList":[{"id":"nm6262744","name":"Aimi Tanaka"},{"id":"nm7611367","name":"Akari Kageyama"},{"id":"nm3211484","name":"Emily Neves"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm6262744","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aimi Tanaka","asCharacter":"Umaru Domaas Umaru Doma"},{"id":"nm7611367","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Akari Kageyama","asCharacter":"Nana Ebinaas Nana Ebina"},{"id":"nm3211484","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGZhOTc5MzktNTdkOS00ZGY0LThjZGEtOTczZDQyMjBiY2Y1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Neves","asCharacter":"Umaru Domaas Umaru Doma"},{"id":"nm7659257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sara Ornelas","asCharacter":"Nana Ebinaas Nana Ebina"},{"id":"nm5329879","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Haruka Shiraishi","asCharacter":"Kirie Motobaas Kirie Motoba"},{"id":"nm3617620","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jad Saxton","asCharacter":"Kirie Matobaas Kirie Matoba"},{"id":"nm6607112","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yurina Furukawa","asCharacter":"Sylphynford Tachibanaas Sylphynford Tachibana"},{"id":"nm3931422","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzljMDkzMzgtNWE0Yy00YzhhLWJlZTktZjZmYjcxMjVkMDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQyODc0Mzc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christina Marie Kelly","asCharacter":"Sylphynford Tachibanaas Sylphynford Tachibana"},{"id":"nm3998462","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Adam Noble","asCharacter":"Taihei Domaas Taihei Doma"},{"id":"nm1261186","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kenji Nojima","asCharacter":"Taihei Domaas Taihei Doma"},{"id":"nm6569624","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Himika Akaneya","asCharacter":"Schoolgirlas Schoolgirl…"},{"id":"nm5692375","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hiroki Maeda","asCharacter":"Schoolboyas Schoolboy…"},{"id":"nm7336696","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Katelyn Barr","asCharacter":"Teeny Bopper Clipas Teeny Bopper Clip…"},{"id":"nm7124126","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ikuto Kanemasa","asCharacter":"Announceras Announcer…"},{"id":"nm0235103","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjExMDk3ODczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0ODkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Douglas","asCharacter":"Takeshi 'Bomber' Matobaas Takeshi 'Bomber' Matoba"},{"id":"nm7659217","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmFkMTQxMTEtZWMyNy00ZThlLThiM2EtN2VkM2IxZjJhYzhkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjY1NDk2OTU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Scott Gibbs","asCharacter":"Alex Tachibanaas Alex Tachibana"},{"id":"nm1408034","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTFlYzJiODQtZjk1Mi00Mjk4LWI0MjktN2E2MGU0NjlmYzY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzM4MjM0Nzg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Allison L.
