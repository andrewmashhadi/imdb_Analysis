Back then, there were no \"time-outs,\" no one had any \"boundaries\" and their parents had no idea what their kids were really up to. Now Dave and Vicky have their own teenagers, and anything they might even dream of doing, Dave and Vicky have already done at least twice. But knowledge isn't power--it's a giant pain; every day is a battle to keep their teens in line. Hillary, 16, is a know-it-all just emerging onto the dating scene; 15-year-old Larry isn't exactly a frequent diner at the cool kids' table in the cafeteria; and 13-year-old Mike is all hormones and video games. Dave and Vicky figure if they can send these three off to college without a police record or kids of their own, they've done their job. This witty, irreverent show goes inside the heads of a modern family through the use of a confessional space where the characters reveal everything they could never actually say to one another.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 8 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Michael Rapaport, Anita Barone, Kaylee DeFer","starList":[{"id":"nm0001650","name":"Michael Rapaport"},{"id":"nm0056342","name":"Anita Barone"},{"id":"nm1560236","name":"Kaylee DeFer"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001650","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2NTQ0NTI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEwNTA3OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Michael Rapaport","asCharacter":"Dave Goldas Dave Gold"},{"id":"nm0056342","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzlkZDY0MzItMmQ4ZC00NjY5LTgwNDEtMjU1ZjdjOGRkYWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM5NzMyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.webp","name":"Anita Barone","asCharacter":"Vicky Goldas Vicky Gold"},{"id":"nm1560236","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MjYzODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDIyNzcy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Kaylee DeFer","asCharacter":"Hillary Goldas Hillary Gold"},{"id":"nm0838202","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwOTMyOTI1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMyNDEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Kyle Sullivan","asCharacter":"Larry Goldas Larry Gold"},{"id":"nm1707083","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjQ2MTcwMzEyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwMzIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Dean Collins","asCharacter":"Mike Goldas Mike Gold"},{"id":"nm1785339","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODA3OTM4ODU0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQ5Njg3NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Rami Malek","asCharacter":"Kennyas Kenny"},{"id":"nm0569711","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzY1OTk1MjM4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI5NDY2MDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Tom McGowan","asCharacter":"Joeas Joe"},{"id":"nm2065471","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Zoe Di Stefano","asCharacter":"Brendaas Brenda"},{"id":"nm1212896","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU5MDk4MDg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDI1NTk1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Lil' Fizz","asCharacter":"Tayeas Taye"},{"id":"nm0319036","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2OTM1NzMwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQwNjc4OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Anita Gillette","asCharacter":"Bettyas Betty"},{"id":"nm0555751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2FmNjFiZjUtNTc4NS00ODc4LWJmNjEtOTdiMzgzMDVkYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjcxMDYyMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Kirsten Maryott","asCharacter":"Winnieas Winnie"},{"id":"nm0823693","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWU3OTA1MmMtMzljMi00OTE3LTg1OGEtODRhOGQ1Mjc2NGExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM3OTQzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Todd Stashwick","asCharacter":"Jeffas Jeff"},{"id":"nm0423111","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTMwMjU1Mzg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4MDAwNDE@._V1_Ratio1.7143_AL_.webp","name":"Courtney Jines","asCharacter":"Heidias Heidi"},{"id":"nm0925857","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzhiZTc4MjYtYjAxMC00MTAxLWEwYjQtMzIxMDgzNzEwOTE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc4MTI1OTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Richard Whiten","asCharacter":"Omaras Omar"},{"id":"nm0611898","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYxNTM4MDYxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Martin Mull","asCharacter":"Principal Finkas Principal Fink"},{"id":"nm0949775","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc4OTkwNTA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyOTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.webp","name":"Keone Young","asCharacter":"Mr. Parkas Mr. Park"},{"id":"nm1796216","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyMTY0OTE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyMTkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Kyle Kaplan","asCharacter":"Monteas Monte"},{"id":"nm2089756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmQ1YmUyZGYtYjAxOS00NmU0LWFjYTEtODJiZjk0YjBhMDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzU3MjIyMzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Lindsay Faye","asCharacter":"Marlaas Marla"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Rob Lotterstein Productions, Acme Productions, Warner Bros.
