After dominating British politics for years, Lang is campaigning for his foundation with his wife in the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's \"special relationship\" with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 33 wins & 56 nominations","directors":"Roman Polanski","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000591","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"writers":"Robert Harris, Roman Polanski","writerList":[{"id":"nm0365249","name":"Robert Harris"},{"id":"nm0000591","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"stars":"Ewan McGregor, Pierce Brosnan, Olivia Williams","starList":[{"id":"nm0000191","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"id":"nm0000112","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"id":"nm0931404","name":"Olivia Williams"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1MjQ0MDg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNjI5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ewan McGregor","asCharacter":"The Ghostas The Ghost"},{"id":"nm0000112","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwMjMxNzM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM5NzkxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pierce Brosnan","asCharacter":"Adam Langas Adam Lang"},{"id":"nm0931404","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzIyOTEwMjYyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc3NDU0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3714_AL_.jpg","name":"Olivia Williams","asCharacter":"Ruth Langas Ruth Lang"},{"id":"nm1256532","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNzA5MDg0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NjE0Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon Bernthal","asCharacter":"Rick Ricardellias Rick Ricardelli"},{"id":"nm0695784","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tim Preece","asCharacter":"Royas Roy"},{"id":"nm0000902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NzU1ODA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTcxMjQz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Belushi","asCharacter":"John Maddoxas John Maddox"},{"id":"nm0000459","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU4MjYxODUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg5Nzg4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.3286_AL_.jpg","name":"Timothy Hutton","asCharacter":"Sidney Krollas Sidney Kroll"},{"id":"nm1338491","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDZlODgzMGItNDIzOS00OWM5LWJjOTctNDM0NzhiNjQ0NjgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY0NzcxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anna Botting","asCharacter":"SKY TV Newsreaderas SKY TV Newsreader"},{"id":"nm3796908","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yvonne Tomlinson","asCharacter":"Stewardessas Stewardess"},{"id":"nm0920574","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3MjUzMDI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTU4MjYzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Milton Welsh","asCharacter":"Taxi Driveras Taxi Driver"},{"id":"nm0563689","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alister Mazzotti","asCharacter":"Protection Officer #1as Protection Officer #1"},{"id":"nm0267003","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjQ5NTY4OGUtYjJhOC00ODk3LWFhMWUtMTdlNzc5MTgzNzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUzOTEwMjM@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tim Faraday","asCharacter":"Barryas Barry"},{"id":"nm0000326","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU4NjMyMjAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1ODQ5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kim Cattrall","asCharacter":"Amelia Blyas Amelia Bly"},{"id":"nm1357559","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kate Copeland","asCharacter":"Aliceas Alice"},{"id":"nm1165499","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Soogi Kang","asCharacter":"Depas Dep"},{"id":"nm3048253","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lee Hong Thay","asCharacter":"Ducas Duc"},{"id":"nm1013098","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGJjYTdhOGItM2M3My00N2YzLWI0YjYtZWRhNmFmZGYzMmUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzE1OTg1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Keogh","asCharacter":"Protection Officer #2as Protection Officer #2"},{"id":"nm3797227","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hans-Peter Sussner","asCharacter":"Protection Officer #3as Protection Officer #3"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Crime, Drama, Mystery","genreList":[{"key":"Crime","value":"Crime"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"}],"companies":"R.P.
