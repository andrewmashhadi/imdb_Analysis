Jack Campbell, a successful and talented businessman, is happily living his single life. He has everything, or so he thinks. One day he wakes up in a new life where he didn't leave his college girlfriend for a London trip. He's married to Kate, lives in Jersey and has two kids. He, of course, desperately wants his life back for which he has worked 13 years for. He's president of P. K. Lassiter Investment House and not a tire salesman at Big Ed's. He drives a Ferrari and not a mini-van that never starts. And most importantly he doesn't wake up in the morning with kids jumping on the bed. After a bad start, day by day he's more confident in his new life and starts to see what he's been missing. Turns out money's good to have but that's not everything.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 4 wins & 6 nominations","directors":"Brett Ratner","directorList":[{"id":"nm0711840","name":"Brett Ratner"}],"writers":"David Diamond, David Weissman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0224606","name":"David Diamond"},{"id":"nm0919289","name":"David Weissman"}],"stars":"Nicolas Cage, Téa Leoni, Don Cheadle","starList":[{"id":"nm0000115","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"id":"nm0000495","name":"Téa Leoni"},{"id":"nm0000332","name":"Don Cheadle"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000115","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjUxMjE4MTQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc2MDM1NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nicolas Cage","asCharacter":"Jack Campbellas Jack Campbell"},{"id":"nm0000495","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjYzOTc0Nzc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ0NTA0NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Téa Leoni","asCharacter":"Kate Reynoldsas Kate Reynolds"},{"id":"nm0000332","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDMxNDM3MzY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzOTY4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Cheadle","asCharacter":"Cashas Cash"},{"id":"nm0005315","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwMDQ0NjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1NzMxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeremy Piven","asCharacter":"Arnieas Arnie"},{"id":"nm0007210","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWRhZWM2YzEtZWI4YS00MDg2LTgwZTYtNjFhYzZlZDViMjg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Saul Rubinek","asCharacter":"Alan Mintzas Alan Mintz"},{"id":"nm0813977","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5OTc3NzMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM1OTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josef Sommer","asCharacter":"Peter Lassiteras Peter Lassiter"},{"id":"nm0891863","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDA2NzdiZWYtOTliMS00Nzc2LTliYWYtZmZhMzNlNDQ2MjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Makenzie Vega","asCharacter":"Annie Campbellas Annie Campbell"},{"id":"nm0587572","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jake Milkovich","asCharacter":"Josh Campbellas Josh Campbell"},{"id":"nm0587574","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ryan Milkovich","asCharacter":"Josh Campbellas Josh Campbell"},{"id":"nm0861462","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDA2ZjY3MzUtZjkzNy00MDY1LWJjMjgtNjg0NjFjNTJiOWNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwNTE1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.7714_AL_.jpg","name":"Lisa Thornhill","asCharacter":"Evelyn Thompsonas Evelyn Thompson"},{"id":"nm0696193","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwMjc3MTYyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzc2NDg3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Harve Presnell","asCharacter":"Big Edas Big Ed"},{"id":"nm0002148","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA3NDY5NDE0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE4MTU0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Beth Hurt","asCharacter":"Adelleas Adelle"},{"id":"nm0005520","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgyMjMxMzU1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcyMDY4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amber Valletta","asCharacter":"Paulaas Paula"},{"id":"nm0948696","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk5MDgxMzA2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTg1OTA2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Francine York","asCharacter":"Lorraineas Lorraine"},{"id":"nm0932137","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGI4MGU0NzgtZDcxZC00OGNkLWFiMmYtMTZkM2IyZGYxZjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU2MzkyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ruth Williamson","asCharacter":"Betty Petersonas Betty Peterson"},{"id":"nm0640887","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NDYzODA4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg4NjcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John F.
