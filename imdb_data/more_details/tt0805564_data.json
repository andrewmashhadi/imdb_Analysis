The only problem is that she's not real - she's a sex doll Lars ordered off the Internet. But sex is not what Lars has in mind, but rather a deep, meaningful relationship. His sister-in-law is worried for him, his brother thinks he's nuts, but eventually the entire town goes along with his delusion in support of this sweet natured boy that they've always loved.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 7 wins & 36 nominations total","directors":"Craig Gillespie","directorList":[{"id":"nm0318916","name":"Craig Gillespie"}],"writers":"Nancy Oliver","writerList":[{"id":"nm1280672","name":"Nancy Oliver"}],"stars":"Ryan Gosling, Emily Mortimer, Paul Schneider","starList":[{"id":"nm0331516","name":"Ryan Gosling"},{"id":"nm0607865","name":"Emily Mortimer"},{"id":"nm0773973","name":"Paul Schneider"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0331516","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMjkwNTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4MTQ4MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ryan Gosling","asCharacter":"Lars Lindstromas Lars Lindstrom"},{"id":"nm0607865","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2NjIzMDg3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ5MzczNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Mortimer","asCharacter":"Karinas Karin"},{"id":"nm0773973","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1MjczMTcxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzOTQyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Schneider","asCharacter":"Gusas Gus"},{"id":"nm0717395","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"R.D.
