Along the way, there's unprecedented access to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service, revealing the complex process up-close, including a marriage interview and the one-on-one Citizenship Exam. How many amendments are in the Constitution? To become an American, not knowing is not an option. Contemporary stories of struggle and success are combined with insightful interviews from notable naturalized citizens like Fareed Zakaria, Alan Cumming, David Rakoff and Isabel Allende.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Aaron Lubarsky","directorList":[{"id":"nm0523815","name":"Aaron Lubarsky"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Isabel Allende, Charo, Muzaffar Chishti","starList":[{"id":"nm0021196","name":"Isabel Allende"},{"id":"nm0004819","name":"Charo"},{"id":"nm4217456","name":"Muzaffar Chishti"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0021196","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmQ2ZDI0OTUtNzJmNS00NDA0LTgzNTYtY2VlZmQ0M2IzOGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Isabel Allende","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0004819","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3NzY1ODIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ0MTkwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charo","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm4217456","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Muzaffar Chishti","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0001086","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4MjM0NDI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg1ODE0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alan Cumming","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0000499","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA3ZGQ2ZmYtZmViYy00ODBlLTlkODItNmU2ZmNiZTcwMGNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MzA3NDk1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bai Ling","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0005320","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4NzE5ODIxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc2MTU5Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paulina Porizkova","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0974536","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Rakoff","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1821472","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2MDk2NDQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA1MzMwNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fareed Zakaria","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"}],"companies":"Flicker Flacker Films, Busboy Productions, A&E IndieFilms","companyList":[{"id":"co0281569","name":"Flicker Flacker Films"},{"id":"co0176273","name":"Busboy Productions"},{"id":"co0152564","name":"A&E IndieFilms"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"6.4","imDbRatingVotes":"16","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"naturalization,immigration","keywordList":["naturalization","immigration"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
