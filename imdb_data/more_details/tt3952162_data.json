Nigel is the brain child of Graham Garfield Barnard and Tim Newsom (with Barnard doing the voice of Nigel from episode 26). The Show is screened weekly from February 2007 until 2021. Nigel has a unique way of presenting movies, using cleaver satire, with images shown in the top right hand corner of the screen, which would add to his remarks. Occasional he would conduct interviews, which included Shane Porteus and Ralph Baker, who had both played the horror host Deadly Earnest in the 1960-1970's. Nigel would often present the movies wearing a stylish blue jacket, but I do not think he wears any trousers. His wardrobe is not restricted to this single jacket. He has a great array of tops including a purple smoking jacket ensemble.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Nigel Honeybone, Mark Spain, Nikki Vukas","starList":[{"id":"nm7375552","name":"Nigel Honeybone"},{"id":"nm0816679","name":"Mark Spain"},{"id":"nm6984743","name":"Nikki Vukas"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm7375552","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTdlNjZhZDktOTU5OC00ZDNkLTlhMTgtMDQ0ZWYyZGViNmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.3286_AL_.jpg","name":"Nigel Honeybone","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0816679","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mark Spain","asCharacter":"Grave Robberas Grave Robber…"},{"id":"nm6984743","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nikki Vukas","asCharacter":"Grave Robberas Grave Robber…"},{"id":"nm1779925","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTE0MWNjZGItOGU2Ni00OGFlLTg0OWMtNDQzMDQyZjBmOWUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0429_AL_.jpg","name":"Graham Garfield Barnard","asCharacter":"Nigel Honeyboneas Nigel Honeybone"},{"id":"nm6984749","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Iain Triffitt","asCharacter":"Nigel Honeyboneas Nigel Honeybone"},{"id":"nm0360141","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzEzOTYyZWEtYTkzZi00NzdlLTkzZDItMzA3NTlmM2ExYmIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shane Porteous","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1448998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDAwNDViOWYtZjBlNi00YzM1LWIyMWUtMWQxZTJkZmM0YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ralph Baker","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1429402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmJhNDU2YzUtYzA4Zi00YjJlLTk2YTItZjFjYzNmMjFmYTUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjA4NDkyNjk@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jed Rowen","asCharacter":"Sluggoas Sluggo"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"}],"companies":"Barnard's Star Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0145794","name":"Barnard's Star Productions"}],"countries":"Australia","countryList":[{"key":"Australia","value":"Australia"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"7.1","imDbRatingVotes":"21","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"You wont meet anyone with a bigger backbone than this friendly skeleton!","keywords":"horror host,skeleton,skeleton horror host,australian horror host,male horror host","keywordList":["horror host","skeleton","skeleton horror host","australian horror host","male horror host"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Graham Garfield Barnard, Tim Newsom","creatorList":[{"id":"nm1779925","name":"Graham Garfield Barnard"},{"id":"nm1780198","name":"Tim Newsom"}],"seasons":["1","3","4","5","6","7","8","9"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
