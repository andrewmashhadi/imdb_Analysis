Zatch and Kiyo fight back, but are unable to penetrate Zabas' wings. Meanwhile, Lien takes that chance to run over to the jail cell and get Wonrei out, but he surprises her by telling her to 'Go home.' The reason Wonrei left Lien was because he feared getting her more involved and hurt. Though beaten up by Zabas' attacks, Zatch and Kiyo scold Wonrei harshly. Wonrei realizes what he is truly supposed to do. He uses his spell to blast Zabas away. Infuriated by the unexpected damage, Zabas and Galliont deliver persistent attacks. However, Wonrei combines Kung Fu and magic powers into brilliant techniques, and defeats the two again. Lien and Wonrei thank Kiyo and Zatch, and leave before the criminals can catch them. After Wonrei and Lien leave, Zabas and Galliont challenge Kiyo and Zatch to fight. However, during the previous fight, the Fifth Spell had appeared in Zatch's book. Its sheer strength and piercing force rips through Zabas' wings and finally brings victory to Kiyo and Zatch. Meanwhile, Wonrei is standing face-to-face with Pakron, Lien's father and head of the crime gang. Pakron prepares to hurt Wonrei for involving his daughter in danger again, but then accepting Wonrei's unwavering determination to defend and protect Lien, he decides to let the two go. Lien and Wonrei leave the island on a boat, looking forward to upcoming battles due to the pact they made with Kiyo and Zatch for both of them to work toward becoming a kind King.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Tetsuji Nakamura","directorList":[{"id":"nm2238899","name":"Tetsuji Nakamura"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Ikue Ôtani, Takahiro Sakurai, Gwendoline Yeo","starList":[{"id":"nm0649026","name":"Ikue Ôtani"},{"id":"nm0757327","name":"Takahiro Sakurai"},{"id":"nm1290102","name":"Gwendoline Yeo"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0649026","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjJiNjBmZGMtNGUwNy00NmRhLWI4YjUtYmZhNGI0ZDc2ZmNhL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEzNjA2NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ikue Ôtani","asCharacter":"Gash Bellas Gash Bell"},{"id":"nm0757327","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmIyMGYyOTYtMGQ5OS00MWM3LWIxNzUtYTkyOWExOWQ4YjhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Takahiro Sakurai","asCharacter":"Kiyomaro Takamineas Kiyomaro Takamine"},{"id":"nm1290102","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA3NDU2MDA2NTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU5Nzg1NjQx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gwendoline Yeo","asCharacter":"Li-Enas Li-En"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"Canal Sur Televisión, Morena Films, ShoPro Entertainment","companyList":[{"id":"co0048117","name":"Canal Sur Televisión"},{"id":"co0080779","name":"Morena Films"},{"id":"co0099775","name":"ShoPro Entertainment"}],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":"TV-Y7","imDbRating":"8.7","imDbRatingVotes":"9","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0455295","seriesTitle":"Zatch Bell!","seriesFullTitle":"Zatch Bell!
