However, the Evans family never gives up trying to make the best of things. While Florida and James struggle to provide for their family, their sons, J.J., an aspiring painter, and Micheal, the undying political crusader, cause trouble while their sister, Thelma, stands between them as the voice of reason. Living in the same building were Willona Woods, Florida's best friend from high school who provided support, love and gossip and Nathan Bookman, the overweight janitor who gave them grief and was the butt of a lot of fat jokes, especially Willona who often referred to him as Buffalo Butt or Booger. Life, at least, is never boring while they fight to keep their heads above water and one day leave the projects, which they did in the series finale. Sadly, it was without James, who was killed off in the 4th season.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 7 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Ja'net DuBois, Ralph Carter, BernNadette Stanis","starList":[{"id":"nm0238840","name":"Ja'net DuBois"},{"id":"nm0141876","name":"Ralph Carter"},{"id":"nm0822304","name":"BernNadette Stanis"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0238840","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0ODY2MTg2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzUwOTgzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ja'net DuBois","asCharacter":"Willona Woodsas Willona Woods"},{"id":"nm0141876","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDIzYzE0NmYtMjE4Mi00NTgyLWFlYTctNWU2N2ZiYmI4NDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ralph Carter","asCharacter":"Michael Evansas Michael Evans"},{"id":"nm0822304","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwMDIzOTI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzU0NTk1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"BernNadette Stanis","asCharacter":"Thelma Evansas Thelma Evans…"},{"id":"nm0907858","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2MTMyMjcyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIzODYyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.3286_AL_.jpg","name":"Jimmie Walker","asCharacter":"James 'J.J.'
