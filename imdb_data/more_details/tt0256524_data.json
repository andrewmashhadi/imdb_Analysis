Betty Ann Fitzgerald is a new employee in the company he works for, with the task of reorganizing the office. They don't like each other - or at least that's what they think. During a night out with the rest of the office employees, they go to watch Voltan, a magician who secretly hypnotizes both of them, in order to use them for his dirty schemes. The next evening already, Briggs makes his first robbery, and when he wakes up in the morning he has no memory of it. Things get really complicated when he starts investigating the case. Will he be able to uncover... himself?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination","directors":"Woody Allen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000095","name":"Woody
