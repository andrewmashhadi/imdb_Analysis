Withdrawn to the interior of the continents, the human race keeps advancing, reaching the point of creating realistic robots (called mechas) to serve them. One of the mecha-producing companies builds David, an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings, especially a never-ending love for his \"mother\", Monica. Monica is the woman who adopted him as a substitute for her real son, who remains in cryo-stasis, stricken by an incurable disease. David is living happily with Monica and her husband, but when their real son returns home after a cure is discovered, his life changes dramatically.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 17 wins & 71 nominations total","directors":"Steven Spielberg","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000229","name":"Steven
