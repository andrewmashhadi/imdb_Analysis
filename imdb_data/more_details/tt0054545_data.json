When he returned from the office at day's end, to his wife Dorothy, and his young son Harold, he entered the world of Hazel. Hazel was the maid and housekeeper who ran the Baxter household more efficiently than George ran his office. She was always right, knew exactly what needed doing, and pre-empted his authority with alarming, though, justified regularity.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 2 Primetime Emmys, 2 wins & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Shirley Booth, Bobby Buntrock, Don DeFore","starList":[{"id":"nm0095804","name":"Shirley Booth"},{"id":"nm0120594","name":"Bobby Buntrock"},{"id":"nm0214529","name":"Don DeFore"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0095804","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxNzgyMjQ3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA5MDMyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shirley Booth","asCharacter":"Hazel Burkeas Hazel Burke"},{"id":"nm0120594","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjA5YzM2MTctNmY2Zi00YjIwLWFlNTktMDRlYTNjYjhhM2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU5OTg5NDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bobby Buntrock","asCharacter":"Harold Baxteras Harold Baxter"},{"id":"nm0214529","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjg5YzYwOWUtYjI5Yy00MmZkLTk0OGEtODg0ZDI2MDhmNWYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don DeFore","asCharacter":"George Baxteras George Baxter"},{"id":"nm0086756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmQ4NWFiOWUtNTUxZC00NWM3LWFhMWUtNDQ1Zjc1YjdiODJjL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA4NDY2Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Whitney Blake","asCharacter":"Dorothy Baxteras Dorothy Baxter"},{"id":"nm0697231","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2ExODliMDUtMzVkNy00ZTZiLTg2NGYtNWVhZTJjNjZmNjNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maudie Prickett","asCharacter":"Rosieas Rosie"},{"id":"nm0298435","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ray Fulmer","asCharacter":"Steve Baxteras Steve Baxter"},{"id":"nm0096143","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxNjAxOTUxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQwNTIzNA@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Lynn Borden","asCharacter":"Barbara Baxteras Barbara Baxter"},{"id":"nm0071319","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Julia Benjamin","asCharacter":"Susie Baxteras Susie Baxter"},{"id":"nm0808473","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NTkzMTA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc5OTU2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Howard Smith","asCharacter":"Harvey Griffinas Harvey Griffin…"},{"id":"nm0931547","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzc2MDU1MzQtY2VlMy00ZDVlLWI4ODEtYTM1MDRmMjM2Yzk4L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAwOTU1MTk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert B.
