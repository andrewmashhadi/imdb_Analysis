It's just the two of them but she spends her time making friends with all the animals she encounters, chatting on the computer and reading the adventure books of Alex Rover. When her father goes to do some research but when a storm strikes the island he doesn't come back, she gets worried and frightened. She then e-mails Alex Rover hoping that he will come but what she doesn't know is that Alex Rover is a woman who is agoraphobic and germaphobic. But her creation comes to life and eggs her to go. Unfortunately she has never gone anywhere before and is denied her necessities like her sanitary gel by the customs officer at the airport. In the meantime, Nim tries to be strong while waiting for Alex to arrive.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 3 nominations","directors":"Jennifer Flackett, Mark Levin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0280814","name":"Jennifer Flackett"},{"id":"nm0505662","name":"Mark Levin"}],"writers":"Joseph Kwong, Paula Mazur, Mark Levin","writerList":[{"id":"nm0477279","name":"Joseph Kwong"},{"id":"nm0563394","name":"Paula Mazur"},{"id":"nm0505662","name":"Mark Levin"}],"stars":"Jodie Foster, Gerard Butler, Abigail Breslin","starList":[{"id":"nm0000149","name":"Jodie Foster"},{"id":"nm0124930","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"id":"nm1113550","name":"Abigail Breslin"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000149","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MjgyOTQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDczMzEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jodie Foster","asCharacter":"Alexandra Roveras Alexandra Rover"},{"id":"nm0124930","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4NDMwMzc4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4Nzg4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gerard Butler","asCharacter":"Jack Rusoeas Jack Rusoeâ€¦"},{"id":"nm1113550","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzU5MTA5MzYzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc4OTIxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Abigail Breslin","asCharacter":"Nim Rusoeas Nim Rusoe"},{"id":"nm0138327","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODgxZjRlMDctMGYzMS00NmQzLWFiYzMtOTVjZDcyNDUyMDAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Carman","asCharacter":"Captainas Captain"},{"id":"nm0103675","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDgzYTM1N2UtMWRkNC00ODA1LWIxMzMtNGQ0NDYxYjEyNWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark Brady","asCharacter":"Purseras Purser"},{"id":"nm0799402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1OTA4Nzc5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQwMDEwNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anthony Simcoe","asCharacter":"First Mateas First Mate"},{"id":"nm0048336","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyNjcwOTMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwODI2OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher James Baker","asCharacter":"Ensignas Ensign"},{"id":"nm2786226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maddison Joyce","asCharacter":"Edmundas Edmund"},{"id":"nm0130290","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWFkZDBhMDMtODkwYS00OTZjLWFhNDMtM2Q0Mzc4OTg5YmMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Callan","asCharacter":"Edmund's Fatheras Edmund's Father"},{"id":"nm1036455","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxOTgyMDgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA4NzIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rhonda Doyle","asCharacter":"Shirley -
