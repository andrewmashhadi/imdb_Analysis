The baby being left alone, finds amusement by throwing her toys out of the open window. In trying to recover the toys she climbs upon the window sill, loses her balance and tumbles out, but fortunately falls into the half-opened window awning of the floor below. The mother, returning, enters the room just as baby falls out. Horror-stricken, she staggers frantically to the telephone, and having succeeded in telling her husband's office boy who she is, faints. The maid, unaware of baby's accident and seeing the prostrate young mother, telephones for a doctor. Meanwhile the baby's father has left his office, making straight for home with all possible speed and attracting a great crowd of people on the way. This brings out the police patrol, the office boy calls an ambulance and all tear madly to the scene of the accident. Arriving home just as his wife revives and tells her terrible tale, he is overjoyed to find his little child alive and well in the awning directly below his window and having the time of her life playing with dolly. The task of rescuing the baby is quite a hazardous undertaking, but with the help of his office boy, whom he lowers out of the window, holding him by the heels, she is safely hauled into the room, much to the gratification of the anxious parents as well as the crowd of enthusiastic spectators.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"John R.
