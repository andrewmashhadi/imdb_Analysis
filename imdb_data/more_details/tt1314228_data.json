He's a Manhattan lawyer, seeking forgiveness. She's moved on, focusing on real estate sales. As he walks her to an appointment one evening, pleading his case, they witness a murder, and the murderer sees them. The F.B.I. wants them in Witness Protection until the killer is caught. He's already hunting them. The F.B.I. sends them to Ray, Wyoming, a tiny ranch town, where they stay with the aging Sheriff and his gun-toting wife (who's his Deputy). Meryl and Paul must sort out their relationship while their New York City ways bump up against those of the West. Meantime, Meryl knows two things that Paul doesn't.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 nominations","directors":"Marc Lawrence","directorList":[{"id":"nm0492909","name":"Marc Lawrence"}],"writers":"Marc Lawrence","writerList":[{"id":"nm0492909","name":"Marc Lawrence"}],"stars":"Hugh Grant, Sarah Jessica Parker, Sam Elliott","starList":[{"id":"nm0000424","name":"Hugh Grant"},{"id":"nm0000572","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"id":"nm0000385","name":"Sam Elliott"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000424","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc4MTgxOTk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMjYwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hugh Grant","asCharacter":"Paul Morganas Paul Morgan"},{"id":"nm0000572","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEzMDY0MzMxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzMxNjQzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","asCharacter":"Meryl Morganas Meryl Morgan"},{"id":"nm0000385","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NTk4NDgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU5Nzc1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Elliott","asCharacter":"Clay Wheeleras Clay Wheeler"},{"id":"nm0005253","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTMwMDg1MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwMzg1Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Elisabeth Moss","asCharacter":"Jackie Drakeas Jackie Drake"},{"id":"nm3190974","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Natalia Klimas","asCharacter":"Monique Rabelaisas Monique Rabelais"},{"id":"nm0024188","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxMzI5OTY4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2MDUwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vincenzo Amato","asCharacter":"Girard Rabelaisas Girard Rabelais"},{"id":"nm3502760","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI2NDg1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg5MTYwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jesse Liebman","asCharacter":"Adam Felleras Adam Feller"},{"id":"nm0446672","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyOTMwNTM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUxODA1NjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Kelly","asCharacter":"Vincentas Vincent"},{"id":"nm0319121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3ODI4MjAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA4ODA4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Seth Gilliam","asCharacter":"U.S. Marshal Laskyas U.S. Marshal Lasky"},{"id":"nm0879381","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sándor Técsy","asCharacter":"Anton Forenskias Anton Forenski"},{"id":"nm0114018","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc3ODYyNzY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg1ODczMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Dotcom Brown","asCharacter":"U.S. Marshal Hendersonas U.S. Marshal Henderson"},{"id":"nm2484764","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDU3NDIyMTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQ1NTU5NDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Steven Boyer","asCharacter":"U.S. Marshal Ferberas U.S. Marshal Ferber"},{"id":"nm1285561","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sharon Wilkins","asCharacter":"U.S. Marshal Kingas U.S. Marshal King"},{"id":"nm0005460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1OTI5OTc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Steenburgen","asCharacter":"Emma Wheeleras Emma Wheeler"},{"id":"nm2137418","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYThkZWJjZmQtNGYyZi00MGZkLTg4OGMtMGU0ZmVmMjRkZWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI5MDIzNDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kim Shaw","asCharacter":"Nurse Kellyas Nurse Kelly"},{"id":"nm1964247","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTk3ZGE2ZTctNDU3ZS00NGNiLWFlYmYtMjUyMzJhMmY0M2Y4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"David Call","asCharacter":"Doc D.
