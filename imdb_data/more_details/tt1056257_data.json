There is a panoramic view of Nefta from Chott-Djerid, showing its temples and buildings and the oasis which is bounded by immense dunes forming the Nefta Basket. The lake at the foot of the dunes is shown, with palm trees reflected in the water. At the source a number of native women are drawing water in quaintly-shaped vessels made from sheep hides. There is a roadway through the palms, and a bean merchant is pursuing his business in the oasis. A Marabout, or tomb of a saint, is shown.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary, Short","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"},{"key":"Short","value":"Short"}],"companies":"Société des Etablissements L.
