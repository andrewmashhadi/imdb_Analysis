After he pops the question, she calls her best friends and they go into wedding planning mode. Peter has no male friends and that poses problems: will he turn out to be a clingy guy, and who will be his best man? Zooey, her friends, and Peter's brother Robbie offer help that results in awkward moments. Then, at an open house Peter's hosting, he meets Sydney, an amiable, low-key guy. They trade business cards, and Peter calls him to meet for drinks. A friendship develops that's great at first but then threatens Peter's engagement and career. Can guys be friends and couples be in love?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 8 nominations","directors":"John Hamburg","directorList":[{"id":"nm0357453","name":"John Hamburg"}],"writers":"John Hamburg, Larry Levin","writerList":[{"id":"nm0357453","name":"John Hamburg"},{"id":"nm0505648","name":"Larry Levin"}],"stars":"Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Rashida Jones","starList":[{"id":"nm0748620","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"id":"nm0781981","name":"Jason Segel"},{"id":"nm0429069","name":"Rashida Jones"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0748620","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4NTEwNDg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwMDA0ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Paul Rudd","asCharacter":"Peter Klavenas Peter Klaven"},{"id":"nm0781981","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwNzcxNzM1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA5NzU4MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jason Segel","asCharacter":"Sydney Fifeas Sydney Fife"},{"id":"nm0429069","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0ODM2MzQ2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAxNTUxOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Rashida Jones","asCharacter":"Zooey Riceas Zooey Rice"},{"id":"nm1901220","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyMDYzOTI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE4MDg3Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.webp","name":"Sarah Burns","asCharacter":"Haileyas Hailey"},{"id":"nm2676362","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Greg Levine","asCharacter":"Hailey's Dateas Hailey's Date"},{"id":"nm0005326","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3NzAyMTkxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEyMjQ4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jaime Pressly","asCharacter":"Deniseas Denise"},{"id":"nm0269463","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjcwNzg4MjktNDNlMC00M2U1LWJmMjgtZTVkMmI4MDI2MTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MDI0NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jon Favreau","asCharacter":"Barryas Barry"},{"id":"nm0004852","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyNTAzMDUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY0NTg0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Jane Curtin","asCharacter":"Joyce Klavenas Joyce Klaven"},{"id":"nm0799777","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzg2NTI5NzQ1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI1NDEwMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"J.K.
