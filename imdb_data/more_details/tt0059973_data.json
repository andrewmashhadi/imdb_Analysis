He and his crew discover a hidden alien race called The Mysterons, who are curious about Earth and its inhabitants and send signals to meet new life. However Black mistakes a camera for a cannon and orders an attack on the Mysteron complex. This misunderstanding provokes the Mysterons to declare a war of nerves on Earth and throughout the series, they continually make terrorist threats to either kill VIPs such as world leaders, destroy locations such as cities and countries, and in some cases even entire continents. They then attempt to follow through with their threats by using what the Mysterons call \"the ability of Retrometablism\", simply put they can create an exact duplicate of anyone or anything they kill/destroy and it will be under their control. The Mysteron's first act is to take over Captain Black's mind who then becomes the Mysterons top agent on earth. Meanwhile, Spectrum is put in charge of combating the Mysterons, and when one of their other top agents Captin Scarlet is killed and subjected to the Mysteron duplication process, but he was still alive at the time and as a result, his clone was able to shake off the Mysterons' control. This event gives Scarlet the added side effect of being virtually indestructible and impossible to kill, he can survive any wound as he will eventually heal himself to full recovery. This leaves Captain Scarlet to become Spectrums' greatest asset in the fight against the Mysterons. As an agent of Spectrum, Captain Scarlet is under the leadership of Colonel White, who with the help of his right-hand man, Lieutenant Green are ready to mobilize Spectrum forces at a moment's notice from the airborne aircraft carrier called Cloudbase stationed high above the clouds. These include its fighter squadron, The Angels (5 beautiful yet deadly and skilled female combat pilots) piloting their Angel Interceptors as well as a fleet of other Spectrum Vehicles such as the Spectrum Pursuit Vehicles (SPV), the Spectrum Saloon Cars (SSC), the Spectrum Passenger Jets (SPJ) and the Spectrum Helicopters among the many others. So when a Mysteron threat is announced Captain Scarlet together with his partner, Captain Blue as well as the other Spectrum Captain's seen in the series Captain Ocher, Captain Magenta, and Captain Gray, must be constantly vigilant to fight against the deadly alien menace of the Mysterons from Mars.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Ed Bishop, Donald Gray, Francis Matthews","starList":[{"id":"nm0084042","name":"Ed Bishop"},{"id":"nm0336579","name":"Donald Gray"},{"id":"nm0560022","name":"Francis Matthews"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0084042","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTExODU3OTc5NTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDYyOTY5MjEx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed Bishop","asCharacter":"Captain Blueas Captain Blue…"},{"id":"nm0336579","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Donald Gray","asCharacter":"The Mysteronsas The Mysterons…"},{"id":"nm0560022","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE4N2FhOTItYzM0OC00Mjc1LTk2MjItNmRiZDkyMDg1OWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyNDQ2NjI@._V1_Ratio1.6429_AL_.jpg","name":"Francis Matthews","asCharacter":"Captain Scarletas Captain Scarlet"},{"id":"nm0027487","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDZmMTU5ZGUtNzRjNi00MmMzLWEyZjgtZGFiZjM5MTY1ODkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sylvia Anderson","asCharacter":"Melody Angelas Melody Angel…"},{"id":"nm0335328","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cy Grant","asCharacter":"Lieutenant Greenas Lieutenant Green"},{"id":"nm0384356","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Janna Hill","asCharacter":"Symphony Angelas Symphony Angel…"},{"id":"nm0604635","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elizabeth Morgan","asCharacter":"Destiny Angelas Destiny Angel…"},{"id":"nm0561792","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzBlZGI5YTgtMGJlOS00YmNlLTlhZWYtMWRjMGFhZTQyNzYxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUzOTQ5MjY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Maxwell","asCharacter":"Captain Greyas Captain Grey…"},{"id":"nm0929229","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODJmNDg3N2YtOWNjNS00ZTZkLWFiMmYtMTZmNDdlNWJhOWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeremy Wilkin","asCharacter":"Captain Ochreas Captain Ochre…"},{"id":"nm0863968","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTI2YmFmMmEtMzJiMC00NTczLTk0NjItOWMyMmI4Mjg1ZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles 'Bud' Tingwell","asCharacter":"Captain Brownas Captain Brown…"},{"id":"nm0455050","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Martin King","asCharacter":"Guardas Guard…"},{"id":"nm0276872","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gary Files","asCharacter":"Captain Magentaas Captain Magenta…"},{"id":"nm0372242","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWI1MzA0NTMtMDY1NC00MzYwLThlMDUtNDczMmVhODY5OGU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwOTE1MzE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"David Healy","asCharacter":"Commodore Goddardas Commodore Goddard…"},{"id":"nm0946022","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lian-Shin Yang","asCharacter":"Harmony Angelas Harmony Angel"},{"id":"nm0564759","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE3ZDZjNDEtYjIzNi00ZDZhLTgyNGMtY2ZlMjRlYzhlODgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Neil McCallum","asCharacter":"4th Policemanas 4th Policeman…"},{"id":"nm0727300","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyMDMwNjUxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM1MDcxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shane Rimmer","asCharacter":"Masonas Mason…"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Family","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"}],"companies":"Century 21 Television, Incorporated Television Company (ITC)","companyList":[{"id":"co0103353","name":"Century 21 Television"},{"id":"co0103220","name":"Incorporated Television Company (ITC)"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-PG","imDbRating":"7.8","imDbRatingVotes":"1649","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"Captain Scarlet is indestructible.
