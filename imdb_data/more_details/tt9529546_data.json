With the fate of the world in balance, the kingdom of Melromarc summons these legendary figures; in modern-day Japan, the call is answered, and the unwitting heroes are transported to this fantasy universe. Thrust into Melromarc and given the title of \"Shield Hero,\" otaku Naofumi Iwatani is labeled the weakest due to his lack of offensive capability and apparent inexperience. When the heroes part ways to start their journeys, he only has one willing companion: the beautiful princess Myne Melromarc. However, she soon betrays him, steals all his money, and accuses him of taking advantage of her. For his alleged crimes, Naofumi is branded a criminal and made outcast of society. With hatred filling his heart, he sets out alone, vowing vengeance against those who wronged him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Kaito Ishikawa, Asami Seto, Billy Kametz","starList":[{"id":"nm5481013","name":"Kaito Ishikawa"},{"id":"nm4439231","name":"Asami Seto"},{"id":"nm6446676","name":"Billy Kametz"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm5481013","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kaito Ishikawa","asCharacter":"Naofumi Iwatanias Naofumi Iwatani"},{"id":"nm4439231","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Asami Seto","asCharacter":"Raphtaliaas Raphtalia"},{"id":"nm6446676","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzhkNjU5MTAtZDRkOS00Y2Y0LWE1NTItOGUyOWM4NWViMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTM0NzY5MTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Kametz","asCharacter":"Naofumi Iwatanias Naofumi Iwatani"},{"id":"nm5213224","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDcyNGZkY2QtN2VlMS00MTM5LThhMTMtMDE5Yjg3NjhjOGM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Erica Mendez","asCharacter":"Raphtaliaas Raphtalia"},{"id":"nm6889795","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robbie Friedman","asCharacter":"Additional Voicesas Additional Voices"},{"id":"nm2999868","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rina Hidaka","asCharacter":"Filoas Filo"},{"id":"nm5425945","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sarah Emi Bridcutt","asCharacter":"Myneas Myne"},{"id":"nm3788571","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDgzYWIzNjktYjllYy00YWYyLTlkMTEtZDVkZTA3MTFjY2E0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4NjMxMjc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Faye Mata","asCharacter":"Myneas Myne"},{"id":"nm4303311","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yoshitsugu Matsuoka","asCharacter":"Ren Amakias Ren Amaki"},{"id":"nm6233872","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yoshitaka Yamaya","asCharacter":"Itsuki Kawasumias Itsuki Kawasumi"},{"id":"nm6541201","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Makoto Takahashi","asCharacter":"Motoyasu Kitamuraas Motoyasu Kitamura"},{"id":"nm4987686","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maaya Uchida","asCharacter":"Meltyas Melty…"},{"id":"nm3072277","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTg2OGZiNGItZWIyYi00ZTY2LTk3ODgtNzgzOTViYmViYWE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMTc2NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Katelyn Gault","asCharacter":"Mirellia Q.
