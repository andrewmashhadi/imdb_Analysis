They escaped and went on the run, pursued first by Colonel Francis Lynch and later by Colonel Roderick Decker and finally by General Harlan \"Bull\" Fullbright. While on the lam, they became heroes for hire, working as good-guy vigilantes around the United States or the world. Hannibal was their leader and an expert at disguises. Templeton \"Face(man)\" Peck was the team's con artist and ladies man. Bosco Albert \"BA\" (or \"Bad Attitude\") Baracus was their mechanic, but also took care of mayhem and intimidation. The final member of the Team, H.M \"Howling Mad\" Murdock, was an expert pilot, and a certified lunatic--they broke him out of a mental hospital whenever they needed him for a mission.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 3 Primetime Emmys, 3 wins & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"George Peppard, Mr. T, Dwight Schultz","starList":[{"id":"nm0000577","name":"George Peppard"},{"id":"nm0001558","name":"Mr. T"},{"id":"nm0776239","name":"Dwight Schultz"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000577","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1OTczNDE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTY5Mzg3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George Peppard","asCharacter":"John 'Hannibal' Smithas John 'Hannibal' Smith"},{"id":"nm0001558","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5Nzg2MTgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA0NjcxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mr. T","asCharacter":"B.A. Baracusas B.A. Baracus"},{"id":"nm0776239","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1OTU0ODIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc4MDkwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dwight Schultz","asCharacter":"'Howling Mad' Murdockas 'Howling Mad' Murdock"},{"id":"nm0070767","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwNTA5OTk2MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjY0ODU2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dirk Benedict","asCharacter":"Templeton 'Faceman' Peckas Templeton 'Faceman' Peck"},{"id":"nm0191370","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI0MzA2NDAyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzM1MTgzMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Melinda Culea","asCharacter":"Amy Amanda Allenas Amy Amanda Allen"},{"id":"nm0499223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTVkNTNlYmItNjA3ZC00M2ZkLTgyNDUtM2YxODE1ODA1NzQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lance LeGault","asCharacter":"Col.
