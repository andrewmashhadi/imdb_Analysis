Reali chooses the topics and gives each of the panelists, sports writers from major newspapers, a chance to share their opinion, giving them points based on point-of-view, style, and information. He also has a mute button for each participant which he uses to penalize and direct traffic. At the end of each round, the contestant with the lowest score is eliminated until only one remains.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Tony Reali, Frank Isola, Elle Duncan","starList":[{"id":"nm1179654","name":"Tony Reali"},{"id":"nm1946879","name":"Frank Isola"},{"id":"nm6217850","name":"Elle Duncan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1179654","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tony Reali","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host…"},{"id":"nm1946879","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Frank Isola","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm6217850","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elle Duncan","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm7600935","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sarah Spain","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm9021182","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mina Kimes","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1436906","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Woody Paige","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm5679860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2E3OGUyNjEtMWQyNC00NDM3LThmYmMtZmRjOTA0MjNmYjIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pablo Torre","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1099410","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bill Plaschke","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1434296","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDRjZTdiZmMtZDY0My00OGMzLWFlMTctZjE2MmYxODJiYzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"J.A.
