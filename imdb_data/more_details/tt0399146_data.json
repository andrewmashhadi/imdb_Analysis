However, their idyllic lifestyle is shattered when, one night, Tom saves his customers and friends in self-defence, foiling a vicious attempted robbery in his diner by two violent wanted criminals. Now, heralded as a local hero, Tom's life is changed overnight, attracting unwanted attention, and a national media feeding frenzy. Uncomfortable with his newfound celebrity, Tom tries to return to normalcy, only to find himself confronted by a mysterious man who arrives in town believing Tom is the man who wronged him in the past. More and more, as Tom and his family struggle to cope with their new reality and this case of mistaken identity, they have no other choice but to fight back and protect all that they hold dear. But, is there more to Tom than meets the eye? Does he have, indeed, a history of violence?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 37 wins & 84 nominations total","directors":"David Cronenberg","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000343","name":"David Cronenberg"}],"writers":"John Wagner, Vince Locke, Josh Olson","writerList":[{"id":"nm0905957","name":"John Wagner"},{"id":"nm1583671","name":"Vince Locke"},{"id":"nm0647939","name":"Josh Olson"}],"stars":"Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris","starList":[{"id":"nm0001557","name":"Viggo Mortensen"},{"id":"nm0004742","name":"Maria Bello"},{"id":"nm0000438","name":"Ed Harris"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001557","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQzOTg4NzA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkwNjkxMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Viggo Mortensen","asCharacter":"Tom Stallas Tom Stall"},{"id":"nm0004742","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI3NDE3NTAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg0MDEwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Maria Bello","asCharacter":"Edie Stallas Edie Stall"},{"id":"nm0000438","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4NDM4ODc2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5NjQ5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed Harris","asCharacter":"Carl Fogartyas Carl Fogarty"},{"id":"nm0000458","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyNzA5MTUxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Hurt","asCharacter":"Richie Cusackas Richie Cusack"},{"id":"nm1525948","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDEzYWMyMjEtNmQyNS00NGM1LTg5ZGEtNDQzMWFkZjE3ODBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ashton Holmes","asCharacter":"Jack Stallas Jack Stall"},{"id":"nm0534132","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NDI3ODg5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1MzM3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter MacNeill","asCharacter":"Sheriff Sam Carneyas Sheriff Sam Carney"},{"id":"nm0565569","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGNlY2U5YmQtMjVmZi00N2ZiLWEwODktODA3YTViNjRhYzIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio2.4000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen McHattie","asCharacter":"Lelandas Leland"},{"id":"nm0117374","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmM1YmI0YjEtZjFjZS00MDZmLWFhMGMtYjlkYjdhYzg2NzVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzkxMzQyNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Greg Bryk","asCharacter":"Billyas Billy"},{"id":"nm0772704","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDVjZjNjMDItMTJiNy00YzQ4LTg1ZTUtNWFhNjc0MzJkNjNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg1MDg0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kyle Schmid","asCharacter":"Bobby Singeras Bobby Singer"},{"id":"nm0443184","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxOTAwNzg2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMwNzEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sumela Kay","asCharacter":"Judy Danversas Judy Danvers"},{"id":"nm0703499","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gerry Quigley","asCharacter":"Mickas Mick"},{"id":"nm0237034","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmQzOTk3OTItYzU0NC00MDU0LTkzYzItZTEwOTE1YzlmNjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMwODgwODI1._V1_Ratio1.3714_AL_.jpg","name":"Deborah Drakeford","asCharacter":"Charlotteas Charlotte"},{"id":"nm1851025","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0MzYzNTM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzMzExOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Heidi Hayes","asCharacter":"Sarah Stallas Sarah Stall"},{"id":"nm0222593","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNDYzMTQ0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyNDkzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aidan Devine","asCharacter":"Charlie Roarkeas Charlie Roarke"},{"id":"nm0531628","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bill MacDonald","asCharacter":"Frank Mulliganas Frank Mulligan"},{"id":"nm1651158","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michelle McCree","asCharacter":"Jenny Wyethas Jenny Wyeth"},{"id":"nm0560045","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmMzNDgxNTctM2I1NS00NDYyLTk5MzMtYjg5YTc2NDU2MWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDgyMzQ2Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ian Matthews","asCharacter":"Rubenas Ruben"},{"id":"nm0717395","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"R.D.
