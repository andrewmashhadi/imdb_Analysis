Mike then turns away from cards, devoting his attentions to his law studies and his live-in girlfriend Jo (Gretchen Mol), who's concerned when Mike's former gambling buddy Worm (Edward Norton) is released from prison. She has good reason to worry, since it takes Worm only a matter of minutes to draw Mike back into poker action. When she learns Mike has returned to the poker clubs, she moves out, and Mike begins to lose interest in his studies. Worm has a prison debt, and the threatening Grama (Michael Rispoli) wants the money. Mike not only indulges the irresponsible Worm, he gets involved in Worm's debts. When Grama demands $15,000 on a five-day deadline, the two buddies go into high gear with a non-stop, no-sleep gambling binge that spirals downward toward an ultimate confrontation with Teddy KGB.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination","directors":"John Dahl","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001093","name":"John Dahl"}],"writers":"David Levien, Brian Koppelman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0505522","name":"David Levien"},{"id":"nm0002718","name":"Brian Koppelman"}],"stars":"Matt Damon, Edward Norton, Gretchen Mol","starList":[{"id":"nm0000354","name":"Matt Damon"},{"id":"nm0001570","name":"Edward Norton"},{"id":"nm0001543","name":"Gretchen Mol"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NzYzNDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Damon","asCharacter":"Mike McDermottas Mike McDermott"},{"id":"nm0001570","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwNjQ5MTI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzU5MTI2Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Edward Norton","asCharacter":"Wormas Worm"},{"id":"nm0001543","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI0ODU1Njg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODcwODQzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gretchen Mol","asCharacter":"Joas Jo"},{"id":"nm0000518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwMDM5ODUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwOTI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Malkovich","asCharacter":"Teddy KGBas Teddy KGB"},{"id":"nm0162032","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Cicero","asCharacter":"Russian Thugas Russian Thug"},{"id":"nm0406320","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWU5NTg4ZTItZmJjZS00NWFjLTg1MzUtNDEwODQ5MTM3OTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ray Iannicelli","asCharacter":"Kennyas Kenny"},{"id":"nm0001806","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzYwNjgwMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjUwOTc3NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Turturro","asCharacter":"Joey Knishas Joey Knish"},{"id":"nm0326108","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjkyYWE3ODAtMjFiNi00YWIwLTkwMjUtOWU1Y2MxYjI0NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE5MzM3MjA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Merwin Goldsmith","asCharacter":"Syas Sy"},{"id":"nm0957273","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sonny Zito","asCharacter":"Tonyas Tony"},{"id":"nm0609215","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxMDI0OTcyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Mostel","asCharacter":"Zagoshas Zagosh"},{"id":"nm0492906","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3MDc5MTk1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTEzNTI3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mal Z.
