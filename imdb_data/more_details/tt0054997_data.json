His bravado causes him to challenge the legendary \"Minnesota Fats\" to a high-stakes match, but he loses in a heartbreaking marathon. Now broke and without his long-time manager, Felson faces an uphill battle to regain his confidence and his game. It isn't until he hits rock bottom that he agrees to join up with ruthless and cutthroat manager Bert Gordon. Gordon agrees to take him on the road to learn the ropes. But Felson soon realizes that making it to the top could cost him his soul, and perhaps his girlfriend. Will he decide that this is too steep a price to pay in time to save himself?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 2 Oscars, 13 wins & 20 nominations total","directors":"Robert Rossen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0744035","name":"Robert Rossen"}],"writers":"Sidney Carroll, Robert Rossen, Walter Tevis","writerList":[{"id":"nm0140987","name":"Sidney Carroll"},{"id":"nm0744035","name":"Robert Rossen"},{"id":"nm0856677","name":"Walter Tevis"}],"stars":"Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie","starList":[{"id":"nm0000056","name":"Paul Newman"},{"id":"nm0001276","name":"Jackie Gleason"},{"id":"nm0001453","name":"Piper Laurie"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000056","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODUwMDYwNDg3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzNTgxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Newman","asCharacter":"Eddie Felsonas Eddie Felson"},{"id":"nm0001276","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzNzcyNTU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE5MjIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jackie Gleason","asCharacter":"Minnesota Fatsas Minnesota Fats"},{"id":"nm0001453","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTEwMzg5MDU2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY5NDQ5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Piper Laurie","asCharacter":"Sarah Packardas Sarah Packard"},{"id":"nm0001715","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwNTk5NjkzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTAwOTQ2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George C.
