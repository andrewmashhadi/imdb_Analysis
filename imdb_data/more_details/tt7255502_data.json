As Kominsky teaches a class to actors he meets a woman whom he has deep feelings for, but lacks the skills to make a relationship work. Meanwhile his agent struggles with the pain of his wife's death and a drug addicted daughter. Throughout the series it becomes clear that their advanced age has challenges that neither one knows how to overcome, and as they keep onboard this train of life, which is closer to death then ever before, they learn to navigate their way through pain and character growth and set backs.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 12 Primetime Emmys, 4 wins & 54 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Michael Douglas, Sarah Baker, Graham Rogers","starList":[{"id":"nm0000140","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"id":"nm1807222","name":"Sarah Baker"},{"id":"nm4004372","name":"Graham Rogers"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000140","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NzMzOTQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE0MzY1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Douglas","asCharacter":"Sandy Kominskyas Sandy Kominsky"},{"id":"nm1807222","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNjg5NDg1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDM0MTcyMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarah Baker","asCharacter":"Mindy Kominskyas Mindy Kominsky"},{"id":"nm4004372","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGFkNjFjOTItNmEzYi00MThmLTk2MWYtM2ZlZDY4ZGQwMWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzE5NjIzNjU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Graham Rogers","asCharacter":"Judeas Jude"},{"id":"nm2878390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDE1ZjgyZjItOWNkMS00MzFmLTgzYzktY2YxOGIwNjIwYjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgwMjIyNjk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Melissa Tang","asCharacter":"Margaretas Margaret"},{"id":"nm4495300","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzM2NjMyOTc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYzNDg5MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Casey Thomas Brown","asCharacter":"Laneas Lane"},{"id":"nm3748060","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWVjYzliMzgtYmQ3Ny00NTZhLTkxZGEtYTRmNDc5MzlkN2EyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwNjMwMjY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jenna Lyng Adams","asCharacter":"Darshanias Darshani"},{"id":"nm0000273","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA4NDk5Njc3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjc5NDc0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alan Arkin","asCharacter":"Norman Newlanderas Norman Newlander"},{"id":"nm0001802","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWUwOGQ3ZjgtZTk2MC00YzEyLThjZTctMDc2YmE4MGZlMjYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODE5NDg0NTU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nancy Travis","asCharacter":"Lisaas Lisa"},{"id":"nm0652089","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTZkM2Q4ZWYtZmUxMy00YWViLWI5NjctZjcyYzk2Y2VkODgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Osment","asCharacter":"Theresaas Theresa"},{"id":"nm5977545","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGVmNzMxYWEtNDc5ZS00Y2QyLTg3ZmUtZjk4MjkyZDBmY2E3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDcxODc2Mjc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ashleigh LaThrop","asCharacter":"Breanaas Breana"},{"id":"nm0249046","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0MDQyOTY2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU1MTMxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lisa Edelstein","asCharacter":"Phoebeas Phoebe"},{"id":"nm0001663","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1MjUwMjI4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc0NTg3NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Reiser","asCharacter":"Martinas Martin"},{"id":"nm1553620","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI2NTA4OTk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM2MDAz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ramon Hilario","asCharacter":"Alexas Alex…"},{"id":"nm0838360","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM1Mzk2MTg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkxMTE3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Susan Sullivan","asCharacter":"Eileenas Eileen"},{"id":"nm0005286","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjY0MjRhNjEtNGVlYi00YzZhLWFhNDEtMjlhNjBiNzM3Y2RkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQxMDQzMjA@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Haley Joel Osment","asCharacter":"Robbyas Robby…"},{"id":"nm0000678","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5NTQxOTczNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQ5NTc4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kathleen Turner","asCharacter":"Rozas Roz"},{"id":"nm0005412","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxOTk2Njk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTk2MTA0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jane Seymour","asCharacter":"Madelynas Madelyn"},{"id":"nm9360948","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzVlY2E1YjYtMTk1MS00M2RlLWEwMWYtOWU4OTRhYWZhZGI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY1NDk4MTU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cedric Begley","asCharacter":"Matthewas Matthew"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Chuck Lorre Productions, Netflix, Warner Bros.
