Each program was straightforward musical numbers from Welk's band (many of which had featured solos at one point or another), as well as vocal selections and dance numbers from the show's cast. Most of the introductions to the performances, read stiffy by Welk, were kept short. Many of the shows revolved around a certain theme (e.g., \"The Music Man\" or the Fourth of July), with appropriate songs and dance numbers. The most famous of the featured singers were the Lennon Sisters (Dianne, Janet, Kathy and Peggy), who were featured most every week for 13 years. At the end of each show, Welk would invite women from the audience on stage to dance with him as the theme, \"Bubbles in the Wine\" (and later, \"Champagne Fanfare\") played. The show enjoyed a 16-year network run on ABC, and later a succesful 11-year syndicated run. Just months after the original series ended, older shows (from c. 1965-1982) were repackaged with new footage and entered a long run in both syndication and on PBS.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy, 1 nomination total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Lawrence Welk, Myron Floren, Dick Dale","starList":[{"id":"nm0919785","name":"Lawrence Welk"},{"id":"nm1318869","name":"Myron Floren"},{"id":"nm8446191","name":"Dick Dale"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0919785","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmU2NWY5M2QtY2ZiNi00OWRhLTlmODEtY2MwYzUzOWU3NzBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lawrence Welk","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host…"},{"id":"nm1318869","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Myron Floren","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm8446191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dick Dale","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1470677","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jimmy Roberts","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0956641","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Norma Zimmer","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1352653","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bob Lido","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0121261","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmQ2ZGJlYWUtNzNiZC00NzJiLTk0ZjYtZTQ1OWJkNWJlYmUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE5MzM3MjA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bobby Burgess","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1470511","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joe Feeney","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1413046","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bob Ralston","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0241905","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjI1ZjVjMmItNjRjZS00OGYxLWI1MmQtNjYzZjBmNjM4Y2VjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Arthur Duncan","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1411469","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Larry Hooper","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm1293376","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWIwMTYyODEtMDIwMC00ZTNmLWJiNGUtMTc0ZWNhYjUzYTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDMxMjQwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"The Lennon Sisters","asCharacter":"Themselvesas Themselves…"},{"id":"nm1476594","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Imel","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0502043","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Janet Lennon","asCharacter":"Self - The Lennon Sistersas Self - The Lennon Sisters…"},{"id":"nm0502051","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kathy Lennon","asCharacter":"Self - The Lennon Sistersas Self - The Lennon Sisters…"},{"id":"nm0502056","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peggy Lennon","asCharacter":"Self - The Lennon Sistersas Self - The Lennon Sisters…"},{"id":"nm0505143","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Neil Levang","asCharacter":"Self - Guitaristas Self - Guitarist…"},{"id":"nm1464239","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cissy King","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Family, Music","genreList":[{"key":"Family","value":"Family"},{"key":"Music","value":"Music"}],"companies":"Teleklew Productions, American Broadcasting Company (ABC), The Welk Group","companyList":[{"id":"co0212380","name":"Teleklew Productions"},{"id":"co0037052","name":"American Broadcasting Company (ABC)"},{"id":"co0212399","name":"The Welk Group"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-G","imDbRating":"6.9","imDbRatingVotes":"454","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"New Season!
