To aid her, she hires the toughest U.S. marshal she can find, a man with \"true grit,\" Reuben J. \"Rooster\" Cogburn. Mattie insists on accompanying Cogburn, whose drinking, sloth, and generally reprobate character do not augment her faith in him. Against his wishes, she joins him in his trek into the Indian Nations in search of Chaney. They are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who wants Chaney for his own purposes. The unlikely trio find danger and surprises on the journey, and each has his or her \"grit\" tested.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 10 Oscars, 38 wins & 169 nominations total","directors":"Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001053","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"id":"nm0001054","name":"Joel Coen"}],"writers":"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Charles Portis","writerList":[{"id":"nm0001054","name":"Joel Coen"},{"id":"nm0001053","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"id":"nm0692427","name":"Charles Portis"}],"stars":"Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Hailee Steinfeld","starList":[{"id":"nm0000313","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"id":"nm0000354","name":"Matt Damon"},{"id":"nm2794962","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000313","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTU1NjM4MDYzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIwMjMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Bridges","asCharacter":"Rooster Cogburnas Rooster Cogburn"},{"id":"nm0000354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NzYzNDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Damon","asCharacter":"LaBoeufas LaBoeuf"},{"id":"nm2794962","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGFmZDVhZDUtZWIyNC00NzBjLTg0ZGEtY2FhMjJlZWJhZjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcwNzE4OTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hailee Steinfeld","asCharacter":"Mattie Rossas Mattie Ross"},{"id":"nm0000982","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1MzYyMjQ0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0ODkyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Brolin","asCharacter":"Tom Chaneyas Tom Chaney"},{"id":"nm0001608","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5NTg4NjkwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjIxNjc2OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Barry Pepper","asCharacter":"Lucky Ned Pepperas Lucky Ned Pepper"},{"id":"nm0559977","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI3MzE4Mzg2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA2MDMxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dakin Matthews","asCharacter":"Col.
