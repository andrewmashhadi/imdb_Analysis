A complete and hopeless nerd, Melvin, falls into toxic waste and becomes Toxie, a hideously deformed mutant of superhuman size and strength. Teaming with other mutants, No-Zone (whose power comes from radioactive sneezes), Major Disaster (he can control plants), Head-banger (Fender, a singing telegram delivery surfer-type, and Dr. Bender, a stereotype mad scientist, fused together - a hybrid character based on the Siamese twins in \"Troma's War\") and Junkyard, a dog/hobo hybrid, to become The Toxic Crusaders! Together they fight crime in every sense of the word and finally turn their attention on the Apolalypse Inc. of the movies Toxic Avenger Parts II & III, although in the series the chairman is an alien as opposed to Satan. The series follows the attempts of the crusaders to fight crime and be environmentally safe.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Gregg Berger, Susan Blu, Rodger Bumpass","starList":[{"id":"nm0074185","name":"Gregg Berger"},{"id":"nm0089454","name":"Susan Blu"},{"id":"nm0120309","name":"Rodger Bumpass"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0074185","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzZiZDcwNzQtNzNmMi00MjJlLTlhZDEtOTRhOWNhNTQwNDJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gregg Berger","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0089454","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Susan Blu","asCharacter":"Monaas Mona"},{"id":"nm0120309","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2MzAyODc1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTUxOTMwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rodger Bumpass","asCharacter":"Dr. Killemoffas Dr. Killemoff…"},{"id":"nm0251646","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGRmYTY2NmUtMjdjNC00NzQ0LTlhMDctZDFmMWYyODc4YWUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzEzNTk3Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Eiding","asCharacter":"No-Zoneas No-Zone"},{"id":"nm0318027","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmRjYzgwNTgtOTA1OS00MzFlLWI4ZTktNDc4MmU2MTAxMzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3NDgwNzU@._V1_Ratio1.3286_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed Gilbert","asCharacter":"Major Disasteras Major Disaster"},{"id":"nm0547128","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MTYzNzE2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzkwNzQ0ODE@._V1_Ratio1.1571_AL_.jpg","name":"John Mariano","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0564841","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODc1NjQ2NDA2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgyMDUyNTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chuck McCann","asCharacter":"Mayor Grodyas Mayor Grody"},{"id":"nm0713148","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hal Rayle","asCharacter":"Boneheadas Bonehead…"},{"id":"nm0798152","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjAwZWEyOGUtMjMwOC00YWRhLThjYWMtOTg4YWFkMTUzNDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Susan Silo","asCharacter":"Mrs. Junkoas Mrs. Junko"},{"id":"nm0815718","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGFmNGMzNzItMDVkNy00ZmU3LThhNjAtMWJmYjUwMmFlZjE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMzMTM4Mjg0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kath Soucie","asCharacter":"Yvonneas Yvonne"},{"id":"nm0689488","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDY0Mjk2MTY1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQ0ODAz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael J.
