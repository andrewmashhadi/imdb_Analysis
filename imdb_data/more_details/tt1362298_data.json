Courtiers of the 14th Century harass her evening with both temptation and warning. They explore the pleasures of decadence - the pleasures of each one of their senses. The insatiable debauchery of being human and feeling human. This film documents the experiences of such pleasures: drugs, alcohol, dancing and sex, with friends, strangers and lovers. These experiences are here to be enjoyed and so, together, Rosie and her courtiers explore the cyclical nature of human desire. But not forever! From the other side of the taboo, Rosie stares back at herself from within the mirror. From out of the taboos, can Rosie free herself from our eternal desire?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Larelle Bossi","directorList":[{"id":"nm3292273","name":"Larelle Bossi"}],"writers":"Larelle Bossi","writerList":[{"id":"nm3292273","name":"Larelle Bossi"}],"stars":"Bernard Camilleri, Adam Curzio, Aaron Leask","starList":[{"id":"nm3276240","name":"Bernard Camilleri"},{"id":"nm4788731","name":"Adam Curzio"},{"id":"nm4788500","name":"Aaron Leask"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3276240","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bernard Camilleri","asCharacter":"Senatoras Senator"},{"id":"nm4788731","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Adam Curzio","asCharacter":"Boyfriendas Boyfriend"},{"id":"nm4788500","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aaron Leask","asCharacter":"Drug dealeras Drug dealer"},{"id":"nm3291111","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amy McLennan","asCharacter":"Rosieas Rosie"},{"id":"nm1510002","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alexis Molina","asCharacter":"Friendas Friend"},{"id":"nm3289582","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dalys Timpanaro","asCharacter":"Singing Courtesanas Singing Courtesan"},{"id":"nm3291465","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Juanita Timpanaro","asCharacter":"Best Friendas Best Friendâ€¦"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"}],"companies":"Likerish Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0260765","name":"Likerish Productions"}],"countries":"Australia","countryList":[{"key":"Australia","value":"Australia"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
