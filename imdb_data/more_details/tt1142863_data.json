Mickey gets away with a large portion of the family's rather meager income, and is pursued by his wife and daughter and a few neighbors. The trail is lost at the railroad station and the pursuers return home, with the exception of Mickey's daughter, who lingers behind long enough to observe Mickey about to emerge from a baker's barrel. She locks the lid on the barrel with Mickey inside. A truckman claims the barrel among other freight, and swings it onto the tailboard of his truck. At the top of a hill the barrel rolls off and continues merrily on its way until it drops, with a thud, in the Mahone's back yard. But you can't keep a good man down, and Mickey admits that he is a good man, although a little sore after his journey.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Comedy","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"}],"companies":"Pathé Frères","companyList":[{"id":"co0130355","name":"Pathé Frères"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"None, English","languageList":[{"key":"None","value":"None"},{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
