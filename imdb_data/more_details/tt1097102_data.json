Mr. Parrott's appearance on the playground below only agitates him further, but he leaves to get help. Rachel is left up there with him, listening to his confused ramblings. She talks gently to him, and offers him a soft drink can. \"It's poison!\" he yells, and she responds: \"No, it's just bad for your teeth.\" His moment of drug-induced madness is over, and he climbs back, and Rachel hugs him reassuringly. Rachel is the hero of the hour, the story of her bravery exaggerated wildly, while Kevin is taken to hospital. Remembering Dill's artistic rendering of the LSD tabs, Mr. Brisley pull in Dill's mother to try to get the bottom of how Dill is involved. Protecting Anna, Dill remains silent. There's still the mystery of the second tab's disappearance, and the caretaker is tasked with finding it. In fact, it has been affixed to Arnie's blazer for part of the day, but ends up back on Dill's when their blazers collide. Arnie knows about Dill's problem - he can't decide whether or not to shop Anna's drug dealing and save Dill's neck, but that would risk the wrath of Anna and her brother. Miss Carver almost runs over Lauren while she is parking in her street. She explains that she is moving into one of the houses, staying with the school secretary, Mrs. Maguire. At Mrs. Maguire's house, Lauren and Jodie finish helping Miss Carver unpack, and she explains that her husband is away on the oil rigs for nine months. Then someone else turns up - a man called Adam, who's seen the notice about a room for rent. They decide he can stay for a while, though the place is now very cramped. The dinner table is also quite crowded, with Lauren and Jodie staying for the meal, and Lauren overindulging on the wine. Miss Carver is also getting a bit merry, and to the girls' delight starts telling an inappropriate anecdote about Mr. Hankin entering her room only wearing underpants. Still in her tent, Julie sings to herself as she prepares for another night alone, but then there's a cough from nearby. It's just Dennis, who's brought her some chocolate. He's got an ulterior motive though - he wants Julie to put in a good word to Lucy. Lucy then turns up, but it'll take more than a bit of chocolate to impress her - especially if that chocolate has already been eaten! Becky has planned some work experience at a Women's refuge. She and Jacko go to meet Marion at a café, but to Jacko's annoyance, he's not invited. At Kevin's house, his parents argue about who's to blame: his mother decides that there's no way she'll let her son ride to school alone...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"David Bell","directorList":[{"id":"nm0068138","name":"David Bell"}],"writers":"Chris Ellis, Phil Redmond","writerList":[{"id":"nm1019645","name":"Chris Ellis"},{"id":"nm0715087","name":"Phil Redmond"}],"stars":"Ayesha Antoine, Paul Bigley, Kevin Bishop","starList":[{"id":"nm0031137","name":"Ayesha Antoine"},{"id":"nm0081901","name":"Paul Bigley"},{"id":"nm0084107","name":"Kevin Bishop"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0031137","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZThhZjkxOWEtNTg5ZC00NmIwLTgxZDItNGYyMWExNDkxMjk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk5MjI5MDU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ayesha Antoine","asCharacter":"Poppy Silveras Poppy Silver"},{"id":"nm0081901","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Bigley","asCharacter":"Dave Greenmanas Dave Greenman"},{"id":"nm0084107","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ2MjcxNDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY3NjIzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Bishop","asCharacter":"Sam Spaldingas Sam Spalding"},{"id":"nm0087366","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Eve Bland","asCharacter":"Marianas Marian"},{"id":"nm0147008","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alan Cave","asCharacter":"Dennis Morrisas Dennis Morris"},{"id":"nm0180325","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lee Cornes","asCharacter":"Mr. Hankinas Mr. Hankin"},{"id":"nm0186309","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Belinda Crane","asCharacter":"Lucy Mitchellas Lucy Mitchell"},{"id":"nm0202800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aidan David","asCharacter":"Arnie Arnoldas Arnie Arnold"},{"id":"nm0300513","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rochelle Gadd","asCharacter":"Dill Lodgeas Dill Lodge"},{"id":"nm0313292","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sally Geoghegan","asCharacter":"Miss Carveras Miss Carver"},{"id":"nm0329851","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Judy Gordon","asCharacter":"Waitressas Waitress"},{"id":"nm1029924","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Laura Hammett","asCharacter":"Sarah-Jane Websteras Sarah-Jane Webster"},{"id":"nm1585606","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Melanie Joseph","asCharacter":"Lauren Phillipsas Lauren Phillips"},{"id":"nm0493216","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Geoff Lawson","asCharacter":"Mr. Jenkinsas Mr. Jenkins"},{"id":"nm0498704","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Leeper","asCharacter":"Mr. Parrottas Mr. Parrott"},{"id":"nm1484121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jamie Lehane","asCharacter":"Jacko Morganas Jacko Morgan"},{"id":"nm1508068","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Andrew Loudon","asCharacter":"Adam McClarenas Adam McClaren"},{"id":"nm9581654","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Simon Marett","asCharacter":""}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Family","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"}],"companies":"Mersey Television","companyList":[{"id":"co0103490","name":"Mersey Television"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0075512","seriesTitle":"Grange Hill","seriesFullTitle":"Grange Hill (TV Series 1978–2008)","seriesYear":"1978","seriesYearEnd":"2008","seasonNumber":"18","episodeNumber":"7","previousEpisodeId":"tt1097101","nextEpisodeId":"tt1097931"},"errorMessage":null}
