Among the players are: the Caucasian district attorney, who uses race as a political card; his Caucasian wife, who, having recently been carjacked by two black men, believes that her stereotypical views of non-whites is justified and cannot be considered racism; the two black carjackers who use their race both to their advantage and as an excuse; partnered Caucasian police constables, one who is a racist and uses his authority to harass non-whites, and the other who hates his partner because of those racist views, but who may have the same underlying values in his subconscious; a black film director and his black wife, who believes her husband doesn't support their black background enough, especially in light of an incident with the racist white cop; partnered police detectives and sometimes lovers, one Hispanic female and the other black male, the latter who is dealing with a drugged out mother that feels he isn't concerned enough about taking care of family; an East Asian man who is run over but who is hiding some valuable cargo in the back of his van; a Persian store owner, who feels he isn't getting satisfaction from American society when his store is robbed time and time again; and a Hispanic locksmith, who just wants to keep his family, especially his young daughter, safe in a seemingly unsafe world.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 3 Oscars, 66 wins & 112 nominations total","directors":"Paul Haggis","directorList":[{"id":"nm0353673","name":"Paul Haggis"}],"writers":"Paul Haggis, Bobby Moresco","writerList":[{"id":"nm0353673","name":"Paul Haggis"},{"id":"nm0604263","name":"Bobby Moresco"}],"stars":"Don Cheadle, Sandra Bullock, Thandiwe Newton","starList":[{"id":"nm0000332","name":"Don Cheadle"},{"id":"nm0000113","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"id":"nm0628601","name":"Thandiwe Newton"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000332","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDMxNDM3MzY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzOTY4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Cheadle","asCharacter":"Grahamas Graham"},{"id":"nm0000113","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5NDY5NjU3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQ0MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sandra Bullock","asCharacter":"Jeanas Jean"},{"id":"nm0628601","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjMzNTAxNDUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjMyNjI5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thandiwe Newton","asCharacter":"Christineas Christine"},{"id":"nm0037410","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTA4NzAyMGYtN2RlOC00NjJiLWExNzUtNGY3M2FhNjg4ZTc3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUwOTQ2MzA@._V1_Ratio1.0571_AL_.jpg","name":"Karina Arroyave","asCharacter":"Elizabethas Elizabeth"},{"id":"nm0049079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dato Bakhtadze","asCharacter":"Lucienas Lucien"},{"id":"nm0160988","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTI3MzZlMWQtMWZiNC00ZWZkLWEyZmMtOTE5ODBkMmQ4Y2ZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Art Chudabala","asCharacter":"Ken Hoas Ken Ho"},{"id":"nm0181691","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODUyOGNjNzktOTAwZi00Y2VkLWE2NzEtYzcxYjhmZjE2OGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDg1OTgxNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sean Cory Cooper","asCharacter":"Motorcycle Copas Motorcycle Cop"},{"id":"nm0001103","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2MzQ2NzIzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDA0ODY0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tony Danza","asCharacter":"Fredas Fred"},{"id":"nm0202966","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5OTU4ODI1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU1NjkyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Keith David","asCharacter":"Lt.
