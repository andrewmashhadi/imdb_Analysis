This is his fourth year on the story, and he makes no effort to hide his frustration. On awaking the 'following' day, he discovers that it's Groundhog Day again, and again, and again. First he uses this to his advantage, then comes the realisation that he is doomed to spend the rest of eternity in the same place, seeing the same people do the same thing every day.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #222 | Won 1 BAFTA Award, 7 wins & 17 nominations total","directors":"Harold Ramis","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000601","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"writers":"Danny Rubin, Harold Ramis","writerList":[{"id":"nm0748035","name":"Danny Rubin"},{"id":"nm0000601","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"stars":"Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott","starList":[{"id":"nm0000195","name":"Bill Murray"},{"id":"nm0000510","name":"Andie MacDowell"},{"id":"nm0254402","name":"Chris Elliott"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000195","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1OTM0MjEwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQwNzI1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Bill Murray","asCharacter":"Philas Phil"},{"id":"nm0000510","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTJjNmI3MzgtN2Q2Yi00NzQ3LTk2YzQtMzE2MmFkMWVhYzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE1MTYxNDAw._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Andie MacDowell","asCharacter":"Ritaas Rita"},{"id":"nm0254402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2NDY3MDcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjgxNDA2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Chris Elliott","asCharacter":"Larryas Larry"},{"id":"nm0864997","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTYyMTU5NzcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDYxNDk3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Stephen Tobolowsky","asCharacter":"Nedas Ned"},{"id":"nm0236519","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI5Njc3MjgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIyMTM0OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Brian Doyle-Murray","asCharacter":"Busteras Buster"},{"id":"nm0313882","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI4OTE2NjMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwNDkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Marita Geraghty","asCharacter":"Nancyas Nancy"},{"id":"nm0665708","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTM0Nzc3ODA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxMjUxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Angela Paton","asCharacter":"Mrs. Lancasteras Mrs. Lancaster"},{"id":"nm0239958","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyNjk3ODE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzYxNjIwNjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Rick Ducommun","asCharacter":"Gusas Gus"},{"id":"nm0653959","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNjExMzExMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU1OTQ2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Rick Overton","asCharacter":"Ralphas Ralph"},{"id":"nm0241208","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcyNzc3Mjk2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk4ODg5MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Robin Duke","asCharacter":"Doris the Waitressas Doris the Waitress"},{"id":"nm0084627","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Carol Bivins","asCharacter":"Anchorwomanas Anchorwoman"},{"id":"nm0308606","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmYwMGJhZGYtMWNjZC00YTc3LTg1OGItODkxYmJhN2Y0YTRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEzNDYzOTY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Willie Garson","asCharacter":"Phil's Assistant Kennyas Phil's Assistant Kenny"},{"id":"nm0132637","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTdmMTk1YmItZWQ3NS00MWYzLWFiMWItM2Q0ODAxNWJjN2ZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAwNzc2MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Ken Hudson Campbell","asCharacter":"Man in Hallwayas Man in Hallway"},{"id":"nm0687971","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Les Podewell","asCharacter":"Old Manas Old Man"},{"id":"nm0783263","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rod Sell","asCharacter":"Groundhog Officialas Groundhog Official"},{"id":"nm0586882","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Milanovich","asCharacter":"State Trooperas State Trooper"},{"id":"nm0914485","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John M.
