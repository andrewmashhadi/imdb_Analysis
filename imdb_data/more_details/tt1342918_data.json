In the style of esteemed documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles, documentary filmmaker Gabriel Lakey spent six years following this true American original. Some might call Kimball Johnson crazy, some might call him foolish, and others might call him enlightened, but pursuing his passions headlong without a harness can bear a heavy price. Would you be willing to lose everything you owned for the feeling of having tried and lost? Is this pigweed philosopher an unconventional genius who figured out that life is best lived at the outer fringes or is he just the quintessential Don Quixote of broken dreams who never found his way home?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 4 wins","directors":"Gabriel Lakey","directorList":[{"id":"nm1691364","name":"Gabriel Lakey"}],"writers":"Gabriel Lakey","writerList":[{"id":"nm1691364","name":"Gabriel Lakey"}],"stars":"Kimball Johnson, Crystall Sterns, Mike Sterns","starList":[{"id":"nm1691041","name":"Kimball Johnson"},{"id":"nm3246468","name":"Crystall Sterns"},{"id":"nm3244254","name":"Mike Sterns"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1691041","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kimball Johnson","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3246468","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Crystall Sterns","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3244254","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mike Sterns","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3243198","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Craig Anderson","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3243901","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert Chamberlain","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3242041","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Cole","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3238038","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bernie Fairbanks","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1477662","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyOTc3NzAzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTc2Mzky._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeffrey Gold","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0360800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Geoff Hansen","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3241895","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lester Higley","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3020901","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bill Johnson","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3242367","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mary Anne Johnson","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3243432","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kent Maxwell","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3243298","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alan Morris","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm2729205","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ken Thornton","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary, Biography","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"},{"key":"Biography","value":"Biography"}],"companies":"Moki Rim Productions, Corpus Polymedia","companyList":[{"id":"co0257081","name":"Moki Rim Productions"},{"id":"co0114050","name":"Corpus Polymedia"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"8.4","imDbRatingVotes":"13","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"windmill,passion,don quixote,utah,sundance","keywordList":["windmill","passion","don quixote","utah","sundance"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
