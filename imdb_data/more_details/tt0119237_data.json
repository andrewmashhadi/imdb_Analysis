A few years ago, a tornado swept through it, destroying more than half the town and killing the same amount, including Solomon's father. The film, from there, chronicles the anti-social adventures these two boys have. These include sniffing glue, killing cats, having sex, riding dirtbikes, listening to black metal, and meeting a cavalcade of quirky, bizarre, and scary people. These include a man who pimps his mentally ill wife to our anti-heroes, three sisters who play with their cat and practice becoming strippers, a black midget fending off the sexual advances of a troubled man (played by the director Harmony Korine), a 12-year-old gay transvestite who is also a cat killer, Solomon's mother who seems to be the only glimpse of sanity, two foul-mouthed six-year olds, and most importantly, a nymphlike skateboarder who walks around town wearing pink rabbit ears.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 4 wins & 3 nominations","directors":"Harmony Korine","directorList":[{"id":"nm0005101","name":"Harmony Korine"}],"writers":"Harmony Korine","writerList":[{"id":"nm0005101","name":"Harmony Korine"}],"stars":"Nick Sutton, Jacob Sewell, Lara Tosh","starList":[{"id":"nm0840371","name":"Nick Sutton"},{"id":"nm0786580","name":"Jacob Sewell"},{"id":"nm0869164","name":"Lara Tosh"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0840371","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nick Sutton","asCharacter":"Tummleras Tummler"},{"id":"nm0786580","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3MjY1NTMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUwNjQ0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.4857_AL_.jpg","name":"Jacob Sewell","asCharacter":"Bunny Boyas Bunny Boy"},{"id":"nm0869164","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lara Tosh","asCharacter":"Girl in Caras Girl in Car"},{"id":"nm0721758","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcyOTg2NDAxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTIwMzEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Jacob Reynolds","asCharacter":"Solomonas Solomon"},{"id":"nm0234829","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Darby Dougherty","asCharacter":"Darbyas Darby"},{"id":"nm0001721","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTk2OTVjYzMtODY2MS00ZDg3LTkzOWQtZGRmMjFjNGZkNmU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ0OTM2MTA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"ChloÃ« Sevigny","asCharacter":"Dotas Dot"},{"id":"nm0323244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Carisa Glucksman","asCharacter":"Helenas Helen"},{"id":"nm0349955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jason Guzak","asCharacter":"Skinhead #1as Skinhead #1"},{"id":"nm0349954","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Casey Guzak","asCharacter":"Skinhead #2as Skinhead #2"},{"id":"nm0139894","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Wendall Carr","asCharacter":"Huntzas Huntz"},{"id":"nm0492454","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"James Lawhorn","asCharacter":"Cowboy #1as Cowboy #1"},{"id":"nm0321949","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"James Glass","asCharacter":"Cowboy #2as Cowboy #2"},{"id":"nm0808126","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ellen M.
