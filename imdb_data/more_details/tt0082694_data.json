Suddenly, in the scorched wilderness, the hungry for fuel Max chances upon a small oil refinery; however, the place is under siege by Lord Humungus' barbarian horde of biker warlords, hell-bent on destruction and mayhem. Now, to get his hands on as much gas as he can carry, \"Mad\" Max will have to provide the defenceless community with a powerful truck to transport the gasoline to safety; nevertheless, this is easier said than done. Is Max, the battle-scarred Road Warrior, up to the task?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 8 wins & 10 nominations","directors":"George Miller","directorList":[{"id":"nm0004306","name":"George Miller"}],"writers":"Terry Hayes, George Miller, Brian Hannant","writerList":[{"id":"nm0371249","name":"Terry Hayes"},{"id":"nm0004306","name":"George Miller"},{"id":"nm0360352","name":"Brian Hannant"}],"stars":"Mel Gibson, Bruce Spence, Michael Preston","starList":[{"id":"nm0000154","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"id":"nm0817748","name":"Bruce Spence"},{"id":"nm0696463","name":"Michael Preston"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000154","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTUzOTMwNTM0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQwMTUxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Mel Gibson","asCharacter":"Maxas Max"},{"id":"nm0817748","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzODk5ODAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM0OTEyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Bruce Spence","asCharacter":"The Gyro Captainas The Gyro Captain"},{"id":"nm0696463","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzY3MmYyYzMtN2U2ZS00ODEyLTk0YjktZGFkYTZiZWRiN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.4000_AL_.webp","name":"Michael Preston","asCharacter":"Pappagalloas Pappagallo"},{"id":"nm0681041","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODllYzQ5NWUtYzE5Yy00Zjc1LThlNDAtYjNlNjdjY2Q2ZTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.3571_AL_.webp","name":"Max Phipps","asCharacter":"The Toadieas The Toadie"},{"id":"nm0920460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxMDY5MTc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg1NzcxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Vernon Wells","asCharacter":"Wezas Wez"},{"id":"nm0632250","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDY2MGRkMGItOTk4Yi00Y2E5LTk0MWUtMDczYjdjN2MyMzFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Kjell Nilsson","asCharacter":"The Humungusas The Humungus"},{"id":"nm0591755","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWI4NjFmM2EtNmFlOS00OTBiLWFkYzEtNDQ4YjAxMjUxZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio2.4000_AL_.webp","name":"Emil Minty","asCharacter":"The Feral Kidas The Feral Kid"},{"id":"nm0382162","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4MTE3OTIxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTkyNjMzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Virginia Hey","asCharacter":"Warrior Womanas Warrior Woman"},{"id":"nm0953265","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGY2NjFiNWQtODI1NS00NjFlLTk3NDctZjg2YjA4YTI1NmFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyODAyODM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"William Zappa","asCharacter":"Zettaas Zetta"},{"id":"nm0925800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc2MThkZDgtNjY0Ni00MWIzLTgwMmQtYTJhZjQ5YjlkOWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.webp","name":"Arkie Whiteley","asCharacter":"The Captain's Girlas The Captain's Girl"},{"id":"nm0817389","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steve J.
