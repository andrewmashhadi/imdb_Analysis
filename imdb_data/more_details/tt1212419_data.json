George Lonegan (Matt Damon) is a blue-collar American who has a special connection to the afterlife. On the other side of the world, French journalist, Marie Lelay (Cécile de France) has a near-death experience which shakes her reality, and when London schoolboy Marcus (identical twins Frankie McLaren and George McLaren) loses the person closest to him, he desperately needs answers. Each looking to understand the one thing all life has in common, but can never share, their lives will cross, changed by what they believe might, or must, exist in the hereafter.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 4 wins & 15 nominations total","directors":"Clint Eastwood","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000142","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"writers":"Peter Morgan","writerList":[{"id":"nm0604948","name":"Peter Morgan"}],"stars":"Matt Damon, Cécile de France, Bryce Dallas Howard","starList":[{"id":"nm0000354","name":"Matt Damon"},{"id":"nm0208426","name":"Cécile de France"},{"id":"nm0397171","name":"Bryce Dallas Howard"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NzYzNDgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg2MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matt Damon","asCharacter":"George Loneganas George Lonegan"},{"id":"nm0208426","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3MTYxMDk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMxNjc5OTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cécile de France","asCharacter":"Marie Lelayas Marie Lelay"},{"id":"nm0397171","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzExZDkyNWItMDYzNS00MGVlLTllZTctMjYyZGE1MmY0MThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDA4NzMyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bryce Dallas Howard","asCharacter":"Melanieas Melanie"},{"id":"nm0627245","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc3MTQ0NzQ2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE1NTY5Mw@@._V1_Ratio2.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Thierry Neuvic","asCharacter":"Didieras Didier"},{"id":"nm2092144","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cyndi Mayo","asCharacter":"Island Hotel Clerkas Island Hotel Clerk"},{"id":"nm4114436","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lisa Griffiths","asCharacter":"Stall Owneras Stall Owner"},{"id":"nm4096185","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jessica Griffiths","asCharacter":"Island Girlas Island Girl"},{"id":"nm0717262","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ferguson Reid","asCharacter":"Rescueras Rescuer"},{"id":"nm4114429","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Derek Sakakura","asCharacter":"Rescueras Rescuer"},{"id":"nm0001542","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwNjU5MzIyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU3NTQyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jay Mohr","asCharacter":"Billyas Billy"},{"id":"nm0454236","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMzgyNTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ0OTI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Kind","asCharacter":"Christosas Christos"},{"id":"nm0187224","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3OTA1MzA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE0OTEyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charlie Creed-Miles","asCharacter":"Photographeras Photographer"},{"id":"nm3727999","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzY5NjY4NTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg0NTY5Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Frankie McLaren","asCharacter":"Marcusas Marcus…"},{"id":"nm3744576","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0NjA0MTExMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDg0NTY5Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"George McLaren","asCharacter":"Marcusas Marcus…"},{"id":"nm1203457","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5MDM0MDA2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU5NDU1MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Lyndsey Marshal","asCharacter":"Jackieas Jackie"},{"id":"nm1368934","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIzNTA1YTgtYzM0NS00MWQ5LWEzMWItNGU5NjJhMTdhNmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk5OTU5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rebekah Staton","asCharacter":"Social Workeras Social Worker"},{"id":"nm0174834","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Declan Conlon","asCharacter":"Social Workeras Social Worker"},{"id":"nm3673802","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Marcus Boyea","asCharacter":"Teenageras Teenager"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Fantasy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Warner Bros., Malpaso Productions, The Kennedy/Marshall Company","companyList":[{"id":"co0002663","name":"Warner Bros."},{"id":"co0010258","name":"Malpaso Productions"},{"id":"co0013175","name":"The Kennedy/Marshall Company"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English, French, German","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"German","value":"German"}],"contentRating":"PG-13","imDbRating":"6.5","imDbRatingVotes":"92728","metacriticRating":"56","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$50,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$220,322","grossUSA":"$32,746,941","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$106,956,330"},"tagline":"Touched by death.
