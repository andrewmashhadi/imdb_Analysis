As one man evolves into the perfect version of himself, forces more corrupt than he can imagine mark him for assassination. Out-of-work writer Eddie Morra's (Cooper) rejection by girlfriend Lindy (Abbie Cornish) confirms his belief that he has zero future. That all vanishes the day an old friend introduces Eddie to NZT, a designer pharmaceutical that makes him laser-focused and more confident than any man alive. Now on an NZT-fueled odyssey, everything Eddie's read, heard or seen is instantly organized and available to him. As the former nobody rises to the top of the financial world, he draws the attention of business mogul Carl Van Loon (De Niro), who sees this enhanced version of Eddie as the tool to make billions, but brutal side effects jeopardize his meteoric ascent. With a dwindling stash and hit men who will eliminate him to get the NZT, Eddie must stay wired long enough to elude capture and fulfill his destiny. If he can't, he will become just another victim who thought he'd found invincibility in a bottle.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 8 nominations","directors":"Neil Burger","directorList":[{"id":"nm1139726","name":"Neil Burger"}],"writers":"Leslie Dixon, Alan Glynn","writerList":[{"id":"nm0228908","name":"Leslie Dixon"},{"id":"nm2982186","name":"Alan Glynn"}],"stars":"Bradley Cooper, Anna Friel, Abbie Cornish","starList":[{"id":"nm0177896","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"id":"nm0295484","name":"Anna Friel"},{"id":"nm0180411","name":"Abbie Cornish"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0177896","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM0OTIyMzY1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg0OTE0NzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bradley Cooper","asCharacter":"Eddie Morraas Eddie Morra"},{"id":"nm0295484","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1Mjk3NTcyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDcxMjE2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anna Friel","asCharacter":"Melissaas Melissa"},{"id":"nm0180411","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5Mjk4NDAyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyMDY1OA@@._V1_Ratio1.4571_AL_.jpg","name":"Abbie Cornish","asCharacter":"Lindyas Lindy"},{"id":"nm0000134","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNDU3MzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc0MTIxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert De Niro","asCharacter":"Carl Van Loonas Carl Van Loon"},{"id":"nm0397110","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWMzNjEwMzYtNjkzZS00MGNiLWI0ZWQtY2M4ZDgyMGZlZjNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andrew Howard","asCharacter":"Gennadyas Gennady"},{"id":"nm0926615","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjFlZDFiYWQtYTU5Zi00MjRiLThmODEtNjhhZTgwMDQ1NDFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk4NjAzMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Johnny Whitworth","asCharacter":"Vernonas Vernon"},{"id":"nm0032962","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWE0Mjg3MjktNDZlYy00NDBhLWJlZWEtNWJiYmIzMzcxYzBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM4NDEyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tomas Arana","asCharacter":"Man in Tan Coatas Man in Tan Coat"},{"id":"nm0121559","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxMjA1MTE3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzgzMDc1MzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert John Burke","asCharacter":"Pierceas Pierce"},{"id":"nm1622660","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDk0NWY3ZTQtMzkyNi00ODJkLTg0YjktMmNlNjI3OTIxODhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY4OTUyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Darren Goldstein","asCharacter":"Kevin Doyleas Kevin Doyle"},{"id":"nm0251999","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzODcwMTE2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjYxMDkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ned Eisenberg","asCharacter":"Morris Brandtas Morris Brandt"},{"id":"nm1410258","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwNTMyNTUyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU5ODkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"T.V.
