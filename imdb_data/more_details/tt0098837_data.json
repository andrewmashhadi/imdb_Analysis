Hyacinth's passion for flawless entertaining unnerves her neighbor Elizabeth, who is often invited to the Bucket home for coffee. Elizabeth's divorced brother Emmet, who also lives next door to the Buckets, tries to avoid Hyacinth because she breaks into song in his presence in the hope he'll cast her in one of his \"little theater\" musical productions.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 BAFTA Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations
