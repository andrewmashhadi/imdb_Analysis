His gorgeous wife Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) was a freelance journalist. They were both amateur sleuths, and in every episode found themselves up to their eyeballs in murder, smuggling, theft, and international espionage. They also managed to find time to snuggle together, as they loved each other very much. Max (Lionel Stander) was their loyal, gravelly-voiced butler, cook, and chauffeur, and Freeway their pet canine.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 6 Primetime Emmys, 4 wins & 22 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Robert Wagner, Stefanie Powers, Lionel Stander","starList":[{"id":"nm0001822","name":"Robert Wagner"},{"id":"nm0694619","name":"Stefanie Powers"},{"id":"nm0822034","name":"Lionel Stander"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001822","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5MjU3NTk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAzODI0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Wagner","asCharacter":"Jonathan Hartas Jonathan Hart"},{"id":"nm0694619","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODE4ZTA4ODgtMmVmNy00M2ZjLTliMzktZDFiNTRiZmMzNzI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc1OTI4NDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stefanie Powers","asCharacter":"Jennifer Hartas Jennifer Hart…"},{"id":"nm0822034","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4NDQ3NDA4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2NzkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lionel Stander","asCharacter":"Maxas Max"},{"id":"nm0929502","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2FlMmVjOTgtNDdiMC00MWUzLWJkZTAtYTgxYTVmMjBiZTliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTA2NzEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Lee Wilkof","asCharacter":"Stanley Friesenas Stanley Friesen"},{"id":"nm0562775","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmQzNmM4OGYtZGE1MC00NTI1LThjZjMtNDExY2NmMTFmMWQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTE1NDA0Mjg@._V1_Ratio1.1429_AL_.jpg","name":"Mimi Maynard","asCharacter":"Deanneas Deanne…"},{"id":"nm0410472","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWU4MzExOTktZjI3ZS00MWExLTkxNWYtYjVkNDlhOTM4NDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Wynn Irwin","asCharacter":"Lt.
