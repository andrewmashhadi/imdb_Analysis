She plays teenager Daphne Reynolds, who lives in New York City with her musician mother, Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston). After she turns seventeen, Daphne is undecided about her future, so she takes off by herself to London in search of her father. She immediately meets cute musician Ian Wallace (Oliver James) before sneaking in to her father's estate to surprise him. He turns out to be Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth), a fabulously wealthy aristocrat who doesn't even know that she exists. He had met her mother in Morocco and the two were married in a tribal ceremony. Upon their return to England, she left him and went back to the U.S. without ever revealing that she was pregnant. The uptight Henry is already flustered by his campaign for election, advised by doting aide Alistair Payne (Jonathan Pryce). His no-nonsense fianc√©e, Glynnis Payne (Anna Chancellor), and her bratty daughter, Clarissa Payne (Christina Cole), are threatened by Daphne's presence, thinking that she will hurt Henry's political aspirations by causing a scandal. However, family matriarch, Jocelyn Dashwood (Dame Eileen Atkins), takes a liking to her and she soon finds herself trying to liven things up at several stuffy aristocratic parties. Meanwhile, the evil Glynnis and Clarissa conspire against her by trying to sabotage her appearance, leading up to the conclusion at Daphne's coming-out party.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win","directors":"Dennie Gordon","directorList":[{"id":"nm0330140","name":"Dennie Gordon"}],"writers":"William Douglas-Home, Jenny Bicks, Elizabeth Chandler","writerList":[{"id":"nm0392942","name":"William Douglas-Home"},{"id":"nm0081081","name":"Jenny Bicks"},{"id":"nm0151358","name":"Elizabeth Chandler"}],"stars":"Amanda Bynes, Colin Firth, Kelly Preston","starList":[{"id":"nm0004789","name":"Amanda Bynes"},{"id":"nm0000147","name":"Colin Firth"},{"id":"nm0000593","name":"Kelly Preston"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0004789","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjc0OTY0NDk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM1ODY3Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amanda Bynes","asCharacter":"Daphne Reynoldsas Daphne Reynolds"},{"id":"nm0000147","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxMDMwMTI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzQxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Colin Firth","asCharacter":"Henry Dashwoodas Henry Dashwood"},{"id":"nm0000593","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ2Njk3MTUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY3ODM0MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kelly Preston","asCharacter":"Libby Reynoldsas Libby Reynolds"},{"id":"nm1346859","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Soleil McGhee","asCharacter":"Young Daphneas Young Daphne"},{"id":"nm0040586","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0ODU4MTQ3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg0MzMwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eileen Atkins","asCharacter":"Jocelyn Dashwoodas Jocelyn Dashwood"},{"id":"nm0000596","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTI2YTEzYzItN2FlZi00M2Y3LTlhZjUtNmIyODU0ODRkN2E4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Pryce","asCharacter":"Alistair Payneas Alistair Payne"},{"id":"nm0716276","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Reeves","asCharacter":"Sir John Dashwoodas Sir John Dashwood"},{"id":"nm0338785","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0NjA5NDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE5NDAxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Greene","asCharacter":"Percyas Percy"},{"id":"nm0651747","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steven Osborne","asCharacter":"Staff Memberas Staff Member"},{"id":"nm1408758","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mike Toller","asCharacter":"Libby's Band Memberas Libby's Band Member"},{"id":"nm1408675","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Penn","asCharacter":"Libby's Band Memberas Libby's Band Member"},{"id":"nm1406678","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tom Goodfellow","asCharacter":"Libby's Band Memberas Libby's Band Member"},{"id":"nm1405310","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"James Bell","asCharacter":"Libby's Band Memberas Libby's Band Member"},{"id":"nm0711248","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mindy Lee Raskin","asCharacter":"Brideas Bride"},{"id":"nm0870199","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI4MjI0NzY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIxMDAyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stanley Townsend","asCharacter":"Bride's Fatheras Bride's Father"},{"id":"nm0214860","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjQxNWY4NzgtZDgyYS00M2RlLThjNzgtZjgxYzIwNTk4NmY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Raffaello Degruttola","asCharacter":"Groomas Groom"},{"id":"nm1358569","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0Mjk4NTkxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2MjU2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tara Summers","asCharacter":"Noelleas Noelle"},{"id":"nm0095842","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Newton Boothe","asCharacter":"Taxi Driveras Taxi Driver"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Family","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"}],"companies":"Warner Bros., Gaylord Films, DiNovi Pictures","companyList":[{"id":"co0002663","name":"Warner Bros."},{"id":"co0081469","name":"Gaylord Films"},{"id":"co0062957","name":"DiNovi Pictures"}],"countries":"USA, UK","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"},{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"PG","imDbRating":"5.8","imDbRatingVotes":"62759","metacriticRating":"41","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$25,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$11,434,964","grossUSA":"$36,105,433","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$50,732,139"},"tagline":"Trying to fit in.
