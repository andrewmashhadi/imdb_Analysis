They help history along. Give it a push where it's needed. He is a regular human that was living as a pirate a few hundred years ago, when he was chosen to be a voyager. He travels by way of a gold pocket watch like device called an omni. When the light is flashing red, it means history is wrong. His job is to fix it. In the pilot episode, Bogg ends up in 1982 when his omni malfunctions. (He is only supposed to be able to go as far as 1970.) He ends up in the apartment where 12 year old Jeffrey Jones and his aunt and uncle live. (Jones parents were recently killed in an accident.) While there, Jeffrey's dog grabs hold of Bogg's guide book (basically a history book.) Bogg being a pretty inept history person has no clue what to do without his book. One thing leads to another and Jeffrey falls out of the building's window. The only way to save him is for Bogg to jump out after him and travel through time. Now Bogg is stuck in time with a 12 year old kid (Jeffrey), no guide book, and no way of getting Jeffrey back. But he does have an ace in the hole. Jeffrey's dad was a history professor and Jeffrey picked up much of his knowledge. So now the two of them, travel through time, giving history a push along where it is needed.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jon-Erik Hexum, Meeno Peluce, David Cadiente","starList":[{"id":"nm0382149","name":"Jon-Erik Hexum"},{"id":"nm0671375","name":"Meeno Peluce"},{"id":"nm0128170","name":"David Cadiente"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0382149","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTEyMjg2Nzc1OTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ1NjI1Mjg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon-Erik Hexum","asCharacter":"Phineas Boggas Phineas Bogg"},{"id":"nm0671375","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjI5OGQ2YzMtZTNmNS00YTE0LTllNTItOTkwNjQ5MGNlYjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Meeno Peluce","asCharacter":"Jeffrey Jonesas Jeffrey Jones"},{"id":"nm0128170","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Cadiente","asCharacter":"1st Pirateas 1st Pirate…"},{"id":"nm0514093","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjAxYTIzYzctY2UzZi00ODBkLTkxN2UtOTQwOGNhMDgyMmFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMwODI3NTA@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Liska","asCharacter":"Drakeas Drake"},{"id":"nm0411857","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM4NjcyOTU1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ1NTcxNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gregory Itzin","asCharacter":"Davisas Davis…"},{"id":"nm0572279","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bill McLaughlin","asCharacter":"Merriwether Lewisas Merriwether Lewis…"},{"id":"nm0561688","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjliZGRlNGMtZjUxOS00YTI2LTkzZGUtNjI1YmI2YzY4OWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Maxwell","asCharacter":"Bartenderas Bartender…"},{"id":"nm0000408","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2MDIxOTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDQxNjcxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Frakes","asCharacter":"Charles Lindberghas Charles Lindbergh"},{"id":"nm0000893","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2JlYjZkMmQtNjZlZi00NmVjLWE3MWMtMDQ5OTU5OTEwYzk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed Begley Jr.","asCharacter":"Wilbur Wrightas Wilbur Wright"},{"id":"nm0001344","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDFiN2RiNzEtNjczZC00YjJmLWE1ZmMtMjA5MzYzYjlkMzg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMyMjgzNDIz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gregg Henry","asCharacter":"Teddy Rooseveltas Teddy Roosevelt"},{"id":"nm0026930","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4NTk2NDUyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ3MjYwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Anderson","asCharacter":"Abraham Lincolnas Abraham Lincoln"},{"id":"nm0091286","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczMTE4MTQzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUyODUxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Earl Boen","asCharacter":"Reverend Parrisas Reverend Parris"},{"id":"nm0779401","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3MzI2MzY5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxMzkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Judson Scott","asCharacter":"Lawrence of Arabiaas Lawrence of Arabia"},{"id":"nm0195702","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWE2MTJlODctNjkzYi00ZjA1LWI0NzItYTYxYmI3N2U4OTdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM0NDQwMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Gregory","asCharacter":"Lucky Lucianoas Lucky Luciano"},{"id":"nm0232194","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjdkZjA2ZTctMTQ3NC00OGI3LWI4MTktYWFiOGJlNzI5MmQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Donat","asCharacter":"George Washingtonas George Washington"},{"id":"nm0173815","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjJmYzE4NjgtMDdkMi00N2FhLWE3NTYtY2I3YzMzZGNjODBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Comi","asCharacter":"Maffeo Poloas Maffeo Polo"},{"id":"nm0049056","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ed Bakey","asCharacter":"Bastaineas Bastaine"},{"id":"nm0015199","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Andra Akers","asCharacter":"Lizzie Palmeras Lizzie Palmer"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Adventure, Family, Sci-Fi","genreList":[{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"},{"key":"Sci-Fi","value":"Sci-Fi"}],"companies":"James D.
