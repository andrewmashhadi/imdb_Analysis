On the plains of Texas, he crosses paths with Johanna (Helena Zengel), a 10-year-old taken in by the Kiowa people six years earlier and raised as one of their own. Johanna, hostile to a world she's never experienced, is being returned to her biological aunt and uncle against her will. Kidd agrees to deliver the child where the law says she belongs. As they travel hundreds of miles into the unforgiving wilderness, the two will face tremendous challenges of both human and natural forces as they search for a place that either can call home.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 4 Oscars, 5 wins & 81 nominations total","directors":"Paul Greengrass","directorList":[{"id":"nm0339030","name":"Paul
