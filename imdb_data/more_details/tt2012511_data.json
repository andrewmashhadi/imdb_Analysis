In order to not influence the other, the partners initially explore each case on their own. Steve interviews the residents/employees and investigates the history behind the property (prior ownership, murders or other crimes that occurred at or around the property, etc.) to verify the veracity of the claims, and Amy does a walk-through of the building and expressing any feelings, emotions, or other impressions she feels, with any leading items such as photos, personal items, religious items, etc., having been previously covered or removed, so as not to influence her impressions. She also works with a forensic sketch artist to sketch any entities she claims to witness. They then link up at the end to compare notes with those they are trying to help.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Amy Allan, Steve DiSchiavi, Matthew Anderson","starList":[{"id":"nm4244740","name":"Amy Allan"},{"id":"nm3157124","name":"Steve DiSchiavi"},{"id":"nm5041941","name":"Matthew Anderson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm4244740","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amy Allan","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm3157124","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steve DiSchiavi","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm5041941","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Matthew Anderson","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm2995371","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmIwMjkzNDEtMTJiNC00ZDkyLWFmOGUtOWNhNzgwYjI1NDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI5NjY2Mjc0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jefferson Davis","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm11529177","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Leighton","asCharacter":"Self - Journalistas Self - Journalist"},{"id":"nm2618523","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Linda Zimmerman","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm10330691","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzA0N2NjNzEtZTJkYi00NjIwLTljNDQtNTJlMmIyZDFiODY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTY0Nzk1OTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joe Kozdra","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm0720405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elvis Restaino","asCharacter":"Self - House Owneras Self - House Owner"},{"id":"nm10472348","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dana Brereton","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm1801842","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ameya Warde","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm11913924","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzkzNWU1Y2QtN2EzNy00NDQ1LWIzYmYtOGM2YTU2ZGE0ODUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI0NDYxNzUy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chris Sutton","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm7602247","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDQxOGFkZjYtOTJjNi00YThhLTlkZDMtY2FjYjg5NzUwYTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Moses Farrow","asCharacter":"Self - Convicted Murdereras Self - Convicted Murderer"},{"id":"nm7602245","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Evan","asCharacter":"Self - Head Chefas Self - Head Chef"},{"id":"nm7602135","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Benny","asCharacter":"Self - Assistant Chefas Self - Assistant Chef"},{"id":"nm7602244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jeffrey Haveson","asCharacter":"Self - Owner, Plan Bas Self - Owner, Plan B"},{"id":"nm4007905","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGMwNDYwYTYtMDc5YS00Y2Q2LWExYjctMjQxNGIzYWU0MTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sandi K Shelby","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm12188370","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWJjNmIyNWUtMDdlYS00ZmI1LWI3NWUtOGJjOTE3NWExNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3NzMzNzE3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sheryln L.
