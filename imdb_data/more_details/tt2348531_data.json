Plinkett. Stoklasa's and Bauman's plan is to extend their work on Plinkett's broken VCR as long as they can while charging him unreasonable amounts of money, effectively robbing the man. The Show can go on as long as the two self-proclaimed \"frauds\" can trick Plinkett into paying them for doing nothing. They have gone out of their way so far in protecting themselves from honest work by retrieving the lost VCR, going back in time and murdering people. Along the way they met lots of other people in Plinketts home, have traveled all across Milwaukee and even America, living through tons of wacky adventures. The main focus of the show though are the conversations Mike and Jay have about movies they saw, conventions they've been to and their experiences with all of it. Since they both have a background of making videos and movies (together), their analysis of movies exceeds into discussing the technical aspects of them as well as talking about the story. After retelling the personal impression movies made on them, explaining how those feelings are based in what the movie is and giving the viewers a general opinion on movies, that are like the one they just saw, they briefly state, if they'd recommend the movie or not. Convention coverage, on the other hand, is mostly a report of things they experienced going to Movie/Comic/Game/TV conventions. In these segments, they'll always have footage and interviews of where they were invited to and comment on the culture and the people, that go to those things. A lot of Mike and Jay's opinions tend to differ strongly from popular opinions, which makes them unique in the Internet Reviewer Culture.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jay Bauman, Mike Stoklasa, Rich Evans","starList":[{"id":"nm1513241","name":"Jay Bauman"},{"id":"nm1518150","name":"Mike Stoklasa"},{"id":"nm1517540","name":"Rich Evans"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1513241","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jay Bauman","asCharacter":"Jayas Jay…"},{"id":"nm1518150","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzEzNThmNjAtOGY4OS00MGYwLTgyZjAtNjY3MDQ5NTczZmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA4OTY5MjQ@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Stoklasa","asCharacter":"Mikeas Mike…"},{"id":"nm1517540","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzNDUyNDgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzQ4NzE@._V1_Ratio2.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Rich Evans","asCharacter":"Harry S.
