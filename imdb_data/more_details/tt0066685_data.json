He often handles the very high profile cases personally. Helping him out on many of them is his wife Sally, who's father was a detective for the SFPD. In fact, Sally gets so involved that she often puts herself in harms way. They are often assisted by Mac's loyal, but somewhat inept assistant Sgt. Charlie Enright and their hard drinking, smart mouthed live in maid Mildred. Sadly, a few years after Mac's appointment Sally dies in a plane crash. Also, Mildred quits her position and is replaced by her scatterbrained sister Agatha. Also, in later years Enright is promoted to lieutenant.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 7 Primetime Emmys, 3 wins & 17 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Rock Hudson, John Schuck, Susan Saint James","starList":[{"id":"nm0001369","name":"Rock Hudson"},{"id":"nm0775870","name":"John Schuck"},{"id":"nm0756634","name":"Susan Saint James"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001369","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMzNDgyNjUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTEyNDQ2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rock Hudson","asCharacter":"Stewart McMillanas Stewart McMillan"},{"id":"nm0775870","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODc0NjY3NTc1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0NjUwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Schuck","asCharacter":"Sgt.
