To pass the long hours of the night, he starts working the late night shift at the local supermarket. There he meets a colorful cast of characters, all of whom have their own 'art' in dealing with the boredom of an eight-hour-shift. Ben's art is that he imagines himself stopping time. This way, he can appreciate the artistic beauty of the frozen world and the people inside it - especially Sharon, the pretty and quiet checkout girl, who perhaps holds the answer to solving the problem of Ben's insomnia.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins","directors":"Sean Ellis","directorList":[{"id":"nm1193346","name":"Sean Ellis"}],"writers":"Sean
