Oliver is naturally sullen because of his relationships with his parents growing up (especially his mother, who had a unique view of life) and watching their cordial but somewhat distant marital relationship, but he's more so now as he deals with his personal losses. He embarks on a relationship with French actress Anna, hoping that his re-energized relationship with Hal following Georgia's death, and Hal's new outlook on life, will show him how to act in a loving relationship. After Georgia's death, Hal came out of the closet and began to live with a new joie de vivre and have an open relationship with Andy, a much-younger man. Oliver's relationship with Anna has other obstacles, including her own vagabond lifestyle and Oliver inheriting Arthur, Hal's very needy Jack Russell terrier.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 36 wins & 30 nominations total","directors":"Mike Mills","directorList":[{"id":"nm0590122","name":"Mike Mills"}],"writers":"Mike Mills","writerList":[{"id":"nm0590122","name":"Mike Mills"}],"stars":"Ewan McGregor, Christopher Plummer, Mélanie Laurent","starList":[{"id":"nm0000191","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"id":"nm0001626","name":"Christopher Plummer"},{"id":"nm0491259","name":"Mélanie Laurent"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1MjQ0MDg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNjI5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ewan McGregor","asCharacter":"Oliveras Oliver"},{"id":"nm0001626","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU5MzQ5MDY3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMxOTU5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Plummer","asCharacter":"Halas Hal"},{"id":"nm0491259","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NzQzNDc5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMyOTYzNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mélanie Laurent","asCharacter":"Annaas Anna"},{"id":"nm0899681","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDk1ODI0Nzc0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQzNDczNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Goran Visnjic","asCharacter":"Andyas Andy"},{"id":"nm0502097","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmZhMmRmZDktZjJmNi00YWQ1LWI2YmYtNWMxZjkxYmFlZTllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODM0NTM0NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kai Lennox","asCharacter":"Elliotas Elliot"},{"id":"nm0005081","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM4NDcxNjkyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkwMjg1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Page Keller","asCharacter":"Georgiaas Georgia"},{"id":"nm3439694","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyNDI3NTE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc1MjI0NDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Keegan Boos","asCharacter":"Young Oliveras Young Oliver"},{"id":"nm0005415","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTdhNDFkMmItNjZjNC00NGQxLTk3MDUtNzkyMzhkNWQ3ZmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTc2MzkxODk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"China Shavers","asCharacter":"Shaunaas Shauna"},{"id":"nm2878390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDE1ZjgyZjItOWNkMS00MzFmLTgzYzktY2YxOGIwNjIwYjdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTgwMjIyNjk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Melissa Tang","asCharacter":"Lizas Liz"},{"id":"nm3170406","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmZjYzU2MTktZTA5My00NjViLWIzZmEtZWZjYjI2Y2ZjZmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA4NDUwOTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amanda Payton","asCharacter":"Party Personas Party Person"},{"id":"nm3298119","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Luke Diliberto","asCharacter":"Green Witchas Green Witch"},{"id":"nm1086384","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwYTNmZWQtMjBhYi00M2Q3LThhNzctMDVkYmU1MDIyYzE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lou Taylor Pucci","asCharacter":"Magicianas Magician"},{"id":"nm2262926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzA0ZTU4MjAtNWU1ZC00NzUxLWIyNTEtYWI3NThjMmYxODhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bambadjan Bamba","asCharacter":"The Sadsas The Sads"},{"id":"nm2765457","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hana Hwang","asCharacter":"The Sadsas The Sads"},{"id":"nm4478713","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Samuel T.
