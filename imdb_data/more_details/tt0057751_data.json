Minnow is shipwrecked on an uncharted tropical island following a typhoon. The seven castaways include the blustery captain, his bumbling first mate Gilligan, a millionaire couple named the Howells, curvaceous movie star Ginger Grant, sexy farm girl Mary Ann Summers, and a science professor known as the Professor. Despite their dire situation, they managed to survive on a diet made up of fish and coconut cream pie, and were aided by their trusty transistor radio and a seemingly never-ending parade of guest stars who managed to drop by their \"deserted\" island (including a big game hunter, a movie producer, a mad scientist, a rock band, Russian cosmonauts, foreign spies, and a jungle boy), yet never managed to bring them to safety.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 2 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Bob Denver, Alan Hale Jr., Jim Backus","starList":[{"id":"nm0001134","name":"Bob Denver"},{"id":"nm0001308","name":"Alan Hale Jr."},{"id":"nm0000822","name":"Jim Backus"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001134","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyNDczNDczMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTY3NDE2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Denver","asCharacter":"Gilliganas Gilligan"},{"id":"nm0001308","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYxMjY1ODIyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ1NDg5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alan Hale Jr.","asCharacter":"Jonas 'The Skipper' Grumbyas Jonas 'The Skipper' Grumby"},{"id":"nm0000822","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTIwODY0OTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg3MDg5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Backus","asCharacter":"Thurston Howell IIIas Thurston Howell III"},{"id":"nm0769791","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxODA1MzMzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE5ODgxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Natalie Schafer","asCharacter":"Mrs. Lovey Howellas Mrs. Lovey Howell"},{"id":"nm0001481","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4MTc2NDA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzA0MjYz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tina Louise","asCharacter":"Ginger Grantas Ginger Grant…"},{"id":"nm0426157","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNDM1OTQ4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTUxODg0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Russell Johnson","asCharacter":"Professor Roy Hinkleyas Professor Roy Hinkley…"},{"id":"nm0920171","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTM3MjM3MzAtZTEyYS00MjQ2LWIyMTItZWNkMWVmOTEwZDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dawn Wells","asCharacter":"Mary Ann Summersas Mary Ann Summers"},{"id":"nm0561673","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjU1OTA5NDA2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU3NzUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Maxwell","asCharacter":"Radio Announceras Radio Announcer"},{"id":"nm0698512","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTU2OTA3NzgyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDYyODU2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Janos Prohaska","asCharacter":"Gorillaas Gorilla…"},{"id":"nm0780005","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4MzMwOTU3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE0MzkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vito Scotti","asCharacter":"Dr. Boris Balinkoffas Dr. Boris Balinkoff…"},{"id":"nm0514507","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5MTQzNTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTczNDUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Eddie Little Sky","asCharacter":"Nativeas Native…"},{"id":"nm0341045","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWJhYmI0OGItMzY4MS00NmViLWFhNjQtYTU2NDg5ODdjNDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.8571_AL_.jpg","name":"Russ Grieve","asCharacter":"Head Hunteras Head Hunter…"},{"id":"nm0000305","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwMjc2MTgzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY5MzM3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mel Blanc","asCharacter":"Parrotas Parrot…"},{"id":"nm0175788","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgyODMwOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzY1MDgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hans Conried","asCharacter":"Wrongway Feldmanas Wrongway Feldman"},{"id":"nm0588225","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDBiZTQyMGEtZDg1Ni00Mjk3LTk2MTgtMzIzMWEwMmVkMTc4L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Denny Miller","asCharacter":"Duke Williamsas Duke Williams…"},{"id":"nm0372481","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4OTk0NzQ4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0NDUyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Chick Hearn","asCharacter":"Commentatoras Commentator…"},{"id":"nm0624883","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQwNjI1MTE1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1ODc5MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"George N.
