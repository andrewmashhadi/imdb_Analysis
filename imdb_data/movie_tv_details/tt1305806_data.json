That case is the brutal rape and murder of Liliana Coloto. In addition to seeing the extreme grief of the victim's husband Ricardo Morales, Benjamín, his assistant Pablo Sandoval, and newly hired department chief Irene Menéndez-Hastings were personally affected by the case as Benjamín and Pablo tracked the killer, hence the reason why the unsatisfactory ending to the case has always bothered him. Despite the department already having two other suspects, Benjamín and Pablo ultimately were certain that a man named Isidoro Gómez is the real killer. Although he is aware that historical accuracy is not paramount for the novel, the process of revisiting the case is more an issue of closure for him. He tries to speak to the key players in the case, most specifically Irene, who still works in the justice department and who he has always been attracted to but never pursued due to the differences in their ages and social classes. The other issue is that Gómez is still at large, no one aware if he is alive or dead. But as Pablo at the time mentioned that passion is one thing that cannot be changed in behavior, Benjamín learns now that that premise still holds true.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #163 | Won 1 Oscar, 53 wins & 43 nominations total","directors":"Juan José Campanella","directorList":[{"id":"nm0002728","name":"Juan José Campanella"}],"writers":"Eduardo Sacheri, Juan José Campanella","writerList":[{"id":"nm3160078","name":"Eduardo Sacheri"},{"id":"nm0002728","name":"Juan José Campanella"}],"stars":"Ricardo Darín, Soledad Villamil, Pablo Rago","starList":[{"id":"nm0201857","name":"Ricardo Darín"},{"id":"nm0897845","name":"Soledad Villamil"},{"id":"nm0706567","name":"Pablo Rago"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0201857","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxOTAyMTAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE2MTUzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ricardo Darín","asCharacter":"Benjamín Espositoas Benjamín Esposito"},{"id":"nm0897845","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2OTkwOTk3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA2MzAyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Soledad Villamil","asCharacter":"Irene Menéndez Hastingsas Irene Menéndez Hastings"},{"id":"nm0706567","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGViOTMyOTUtN2MyYi00YTU2LWE0N2QtMDQyYTA5MTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Pablo Rago","asCharacter":"Ricardo Moralesas Ricardo Morales"},{"id":"nm3587952","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2Q3N2MyYTgtNmM2OS00OGM5LTg1MzktZjdjOGExZWQ2OGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Carla Quevedo","asCharacter":"Liliana Colotoas Liliana Coloto"},{"id":"nm1024390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDAyOTNjYmEtNjRiMS00MmEzLWIyMzgtMDA4ZDZhYzUwY2Q1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY2MTgyODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Javier Godino","asCharacter":"Isidoro Gómezas Isidoro Gómez"},{"id":"nm3588006","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bárbara Palladino","asCharacter":"Chica Piropoas Chica Piropo"},{"id":"nm3587916","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rudy Romano","asCharacter":"Ordóñezas Ordóñez"},{"id":"nm3596017","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alejandro Abelenda","asCharacter":"Pinche Marianoas Pinche Mariano"},{"id":"nm0016039","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDk1MmY5NTQtZDU2My00MWRjLWE5ZDMtZDdjMThhYmYxMmE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Mario Alarcón","asCharacter":"Juez Fortuna Lacalleas Juez Fortuna Lacalle"},{"id":"nm0289856","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQyNTAyMTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc4MjkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Guillermo Francella","asCharacter":"Pablo Sandovalas Pablo Sandoval"},{"id":"nm3587933","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sebastián Blanco","asCharacter":"Pinche Tinoas Pinche Tino"},{"id":"nm1747313","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGQ3NjRhYzMtMGE0YS00NjZkLTkwMzItMGRiYzQ1ZTgzZjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0ODkwMTU@._V1_Ratio1.8429_AL_.jpg","name":"Mariano Argento","asCharacter":"Romanoas Romano"},{"id":"nm0320227","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"José Luis Gioia","asCharacter":"Inspector Báezas Inspector Báez"},{"id":"nm3596027","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Juan José Ortíz","asCharacter":"Agente Cardozoas Agente Cardozo"},{"id":"nm3587918","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kiko Cerone","asCharacter":"Molinarias Molinari"},{"id":"nm0661097","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Fernando Pardo","asCharacter":"Sicoraas Sicora"},{"id":"nm1142911","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maximiliano Trento","asCharacter":"Guardia Comisaríaas Guardia Comisaría"},{"id":"nm3797369","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sergio López Santana","asCharacter":"Jacinto Cáceresas Jacinto Cáceres"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Mystery, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Tornasol Films, Haddock Films, 100 Bares","companyList":[{"id":"co0033873","name":"Tornasol Films"},{"id":"co0233453","name":"Haddock Films"},{"id":"co0119804","name":"100 Bares"}],"countries":"Argentina, Spain","countryList":[{"key":"Argentina","value":"Argentina"},{"key":"Spain","value":"Spain"}],"languages":"Spanish","languageList":[{"key":"Spanish","value":"Spanish"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"8.2","imDbRatingVotes":"206467","metacriticRating":"80","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$2,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$167,866","grossUSA":"$6,391,436","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$35,079,650"},"tagline":"Un crimen sin castigo.
