However, a hero defeated the device and a great seal was laid over The Machine. In 2707, the depleted world is ruled by four Corporations: Mishima, Bauhaus, Capitol, and Imperial that are in a constant state of war. During a battle between Capitol and Bauhaus, the great seal is broken and The Machine works again transforming soldiers and civilians into hordes of mutants. A small part of the population escapes to Mars, leaving millions of people behind. The man of faith and leader of an ancient brotherhood, Brother Samuel, is a believer in God and the Chronicles, a Bible about the mutants from ancient times. With the city besieged by the mutants, he visits the Corporations' leader Constantine, asking for an aircraft and twenty men for a suicide mission to destroy The Machine, planting a bomb and a detonator following the knowledge of the Chronicles. He recruits the tough Major 'Mitch' Hunter; the Bauhaus Lieutenant Maximillian von Steiner; the keeper of the Chronicles Severian that is under a vow of silence; the gorgeous and lethal Corporal Valerie Duval; Corporal Juba Kim Wu; Captain John McGuire; and Corporal Jesus 'El Jesus' de Barrera. Together they become the last hope of Earth against the evil mutants.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Simon Hunter","directorList":[{"id":"nm0403038","name":"Simon Hunter"}],"writers":"Philip Eisner","writerList":[{"id":"nm0252155","name":"Philip Eisner"}],"stars":"Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, Devon Aoki","starList":[{"id":"nm0005048","name":"Thomas Jane"},{"id":"nm0000579","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"id":"nm1226817","name":"Devon Aoki"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0005048","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTgwMjMwNzAxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIwMDg4Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thomas Jane","asCharacter":"Maj.
