Bob, who has been turned from home by his uncle because he has his own notions of marriage, comes to the ranch and Mary falls in love with him. Bill Rank, the foreman, contrives to ruin Bob's good name and make him \"do time.\" Mary is faithful to Bob and makes a big sacrifice to help him in his trouble. Times are dark for a while, but Fate works things out at last. Bill Rank is hurt in a runaway, and, looking death to the face, he confesses the truth. Bob's good name is restored, he marries Mary, and, to cap the climax, he falls heir to a fortune.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"William F.
