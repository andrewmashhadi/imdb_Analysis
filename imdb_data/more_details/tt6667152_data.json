The guests come from various backgrounds: Christian and Non-Christian, fallen away Catholics who came back to the Faith, agnostics, atheists, and others. The discussion often centers on the reasons that made the guest abandon their former convictions or way of life and enter the Catholic Church. The show is live and features questions via phone calls and emails from viewers in the second half of the show. Every first Monday (in the first three seasons - every first Friday) is an Open-line version of the program often featuring a life-long catholic where Marcus and the guest dedicate the entire hour to answering questions from the viewers.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Marcus Grodi, Scott Hahn, Paul Thigpen","starList":[{"id":"nm0992503","name":"Marcus Grodi"},{"id":"nm7432793","name":"Scott Hahn"},{"id":"nm8939575","name":"Paul Thigpen"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0992503","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Marcus Grodi","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host…"},{"id":"nm7432793","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Scott Hahn","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8939575","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Thigpen","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm4997027","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stephen Ray","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8930499","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bruce Sullivan","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm1030449","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Doug Keck","asCharacter":"Self - Intervieweras Self - Interviewer…"},{"id":"nm8930518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Currie","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm7432796","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mark Shea","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8939560","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kenneth Howell","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm7432794","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Patrick Madrid","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm6689487","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mitch Pacwa","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8939571","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Noah Lett","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8939576","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ray Ryland","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8930510","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Curtis Martin","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm3210333","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dale Ahlquist","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm5574403","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alex Jones","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm3566794","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joseph Pearce","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"},{"id":"nm8939545","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gray Bean","asCharacter":"Self - Guestas Self - Guest"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Talk-Show","genreList":[{"key":"Talk-Show","value":"Talk-Show"}],"companies":"Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN)","companyList":[{"id":"co0253828","name":"Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN)"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-G","imDbRating":"7.8","imDbRatingVotes":"14","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"We strove to follow Jesus Christ with our whole hearts and this led us somewhere we never expected: the Catholic Church.","keywords":"christian,telephone call,guest,catholic,faith","keywordList":["christian","telephone call","guest","catholic","faith"],"similars":[{"id":"tt7772588","title":"For All Mankind","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDMwODYyM2ItZjNlYi00YzAzLTliODItYWFkOWJiMzVhOTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"7.9"}],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"Scott Scholten, Jason Addington","creatorList":[{"id":"nm8951727","name":"Scott Scholten"},{"id":"nm2800144","name":"Jason Addington"}],"seasons":["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
