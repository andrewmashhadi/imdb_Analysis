Shawn tells his pa to consider solving the sex dilemma by dropping every aspect of his life to take a full-time job and marry her immediately, but is luckily talked out of it. Mimi worries how and why lover Rex has got Tuscany matches while he doesn't even smoke -he says they're for a surprise with candles for her- and about his weird behavior during headaches, he admits a major blackout around Abe's murder and curses Stefano's mysterious plan; they kiss up, he leaves after another round of why-rich-Tony-as-father-but-Roman-may-not-know; Bonnie, now a maid at the DiMera mansion, drops by to insist daughter Mimi should marry Rex and certainly accept his money, for both of them. Rex goes to Tony's, where ex-nanny Céleste has the arrogance to object to Lexie moving back in, openly suspecting Rex, Tony defends him unconditionally and forbids him to take a lie-detector test, ever. The only one on Roman's PD team who does more then wine and boast revenge-promises against the DiMera suspects from a long list, is latest technology addition TEK Kramer (now ex-ISA), who finds the evidence-arsonist left a Tuscany matchbook from the new series with a slightly changed logo which Maggy started using in the restaurant only that night, but except Rex all suspects were there then, and even he could have got one from Cassie; the only fingerprint on it fits no suspect, but Maggie. John has set himself up as next victim, and indeed someone in black sneaks onto him at home...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Stephen Wyman","directorList":[{"id":"nm0943852","name":"Stephen Wyman"}],"writers":"Dena Higley, James E.
