What are they? An escape from reality or reality itself? Waking Life follows the dream(s) of one man and his attempt to find and discern the absolute difference between waking life and the dreamworld. While trying to figure out a way to wake up, he runs into many people on his way; some of which offer one sentence asides on life, others delving deeply into existential questions and life's mysteries. We become the main character. It becomes our dream and our questions being asked and answered. Can we control our dreams? What are they telling us about life? About death? About ourselves and where we come from and where we are going? The film does not answer all these for us. Instead, it inspires us to ask the questions and find the answers ourselves.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 21 nominations","directors":"Richard Linklater","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000500","name":"Richard Linklater"}],"writers":"Richard Linklater","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000500","name":"Richard Linklater"}],"stars":"Ethan Hawke, Trevor Jack Brooks, Lorelei Linklater","starList":[{"id":"nm0000160","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"id":"nm1085025","name":"Trevor Jack Brooks"},{"id":"nm1085951","name":"Lorelei Linklater"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000160","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4NDMxMTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE3ODE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ethan Hawke","asCharacter":"Jesseas Jesse"},{"id":"nm1085025","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Trevor Jack Brooks","asCharacter":"Young Boy Playing Paper Gameas Young Boy Playing Paper Game"},{"id":"nm1085951","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2Y5Yjg2MjAtYzIzNC00NzMzLWJiOWYtZTk2MjA3MTY5OGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Lorelei Linklater","asCharacter":"Young Girl Playing Paper Gameas Young Girl Playing Paper Game"},{"id":"nm0927812","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE3NzQxNjEzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk4NzAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Wiley Wiggins","asCharacter":"Main Characteras Main Character"},{"id":"nm0318666","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Glover Gill","asCharacter":"Accordion Playeras Accordion Player"},{"id":"nm1153189","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lara Hicks","asCharacter":"Violin Playeras Violin Player"},{"id":"nm1147685","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ames Asbell","asCharacter":"Viola Playeras Viola Player"},{"id":"nm1149851","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Leigh Mahoney","asCharacter":"Viola Playeras Viola Player"},{"id":"nm1153280","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sara Nelson","asCharacter":"Cello Playeras Cello Player"},{"id":"nm1147699","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jeanine Attaway","asCharacter":"Piano Playeras Piano Player"},{"id":"nm1148970","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Erik Grostic","asCharacter":"Bass Playeras Bass Player"},{"id":"nm0936315","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWZkZDZhZmUtNjNiOC00OThiLWJkYjMtZTk5M2FjNjAwNjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ3Mzk0ODI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Wise","asCharacter":"Boat Car Guyas Boat Car Guy"},{"id":"nm1100234","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert C.
