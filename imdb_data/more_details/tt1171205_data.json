Diane explains that she ran across a letter from the sperm bank and saw it as a chance for her to finally have his child. Victor tells her that she has broken the law and betrayed his trust by getting pregnant without his consent - and he will not take this lightly! Nikki thanks Ashley for voting in Brad's favor. Neil apologizes to Dru. She explains that she only pursued Malcolm after it became evident that Neil was ready to move along with Olivia. Neil decides it's time to have a long-overdue talk with Olivia. Brittany becomes upset when she sees how Phyllis has uploaded clips of the fight she had with Billy. Rianna encourages Brittany not to worry because Billy really loves her. Mac tells Billy that she doesn't trust Phyllis and cannot risk being seen on the Internet by her mother. While watching some of the Prom clips, Mac and Billy notice Mac's face in the background... Paul asks Kay and Brock why Mac doesn't want to reunite with her mother. Kay explains that Mac's step-father is an alcoholic and things must have been terrible for her to run away. Then, Paul finds out Jill has flown to St. Louis... Jill and her P.I. decide to call Amanda Browning.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Sally McDonald","directorList":[{"id":"nm0567993","name":"Sally McDonald"}],"writers":"Kay Alden, John F.
