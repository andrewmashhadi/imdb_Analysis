He's always loved baseball and as a way of motivating his players, he agrees to go to a professional try-out if they win the championship. He once had aspirations to be a professional baseball player but an injury brought that to an end. Sure enough, the 39 year-old father of three finds himself at a camp for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and he somehow seems to have regained his pitching arm, easily throwing a 98 mph fastball. Signed to a contract, he toils in the minor leagues while his supportive wife stays home raising their children. He soon finds himself called up to the big club and pitching for Tampa which is in Texas playing the Rangers. Based on a true story.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 4 nominations","directors":"John Lee Hancock","directorList":[{"id":"nm0359387","name":"John Lee Hancock"}],"writers":"Mike Rich","writerList":[{"id":"nm0723692","name":"Mike Rich"}],"stars":"Dennis Quaid, J.D.
