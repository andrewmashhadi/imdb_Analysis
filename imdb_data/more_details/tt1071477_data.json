Brandon sees Abe and Lexie arrive for an ultrasound with obstetrician Dr. Bader and tells Sami that Abe won't do as father, both thinking especially for his baby, even tells Abe he's not a reliable husband-father for Lexie while Sami overhears Lexie secretly ask Dr. Bader for a paternity test. Dr. Colin Murphy can't find anyone to cover at the hospital so he is late for his meeting with attorney Raymond Grant. Larry Welch delivers in disguise a letter to Raymond, pulls a gun to prevent the lawyer checking up on him and admits he ordered Bo's dead, not Stefano, and the attack on Victor, is recognized and then kills him. Kate surprises Tony by being at the Brady pub; Bo overhears them fishing and fencing about secrets. Roman walks in. Chloe finds Brady frozen in a sleeping bag on her porch and takes him in to warm up, his mother Isabella appears again. Colin arrives at Grant's office to see his corps on the floor, just quick enough to hide, when his secretary enters and officially finds it, and leave before Roman and Bo arrive to investigate, hoping his files may help bringing down the whole secret DiMera crime empire. Chloe overhears Mickey reading Nancy's medical will.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Randy Robbins","directorList":[{"id":"nm0730439","name":"Randy
