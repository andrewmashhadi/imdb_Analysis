Torn between loyalty to where he was raised and allegiance to his brothers in blue, Daniel \"Hondo\" Harrelson strives to bridge the divide between his two worlds and acclimate to his new duties as the legal guardian of a teenager. Hondo's elite unit includes David \"Deacon\" Kay, an experienced S.W.A.T. officer and dedicated family man who always puts the team first; Christina \"Chris\" Alonso, a skilled officer and the team's canine trainer; Dominique Luca, an expert driver who gets them in and out of high risk situations; Victor Tan, who started in the LAPD Hollywood Division and uses his confidential informants in the community to help the team; and Jim Street, the team's cocky newest member who is re-instated to S.W.A.T. after being fired for compromising the unit. Responsible for the management of all Metro Division S.W.A.T. units is Commander Robert Hicks, a senior LAPD official with the Special Operations Bureau. Following Captain Jessica Cortez's departure for the FBI, the Mayor assigns Lieutenant Piper Lynch to SWAT as a tactical consultant, where she challenges the team's field strategy, which raises questions about her loyalty. With Hondo leading the charge, these dedicated men and women bravely put themselves at risk to protect their community and save lives.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 3 Primetime Emmys, 7 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Shemar Moore, Alex Russell, Lina Esco","starList":[{"id":"nm0005245","name":"Shemar Moore"},{"id":"nm3887625","name":"Alex Russell"},{"id":"nm2128467","name":"Lina Esco"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0005245","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczODMyOTQxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzczMjU1Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shemar Moore","asCharacter":"Daniel 'Hondo' Harrelsonas Daniel 'Hondo' Harrelson"},{"id":"nm3887625","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDdlMzY2ZDktNDA1Yi00YmNhLWEzMTctNzUzNzlkNmEzYTlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.2286_AL_.jpg","name":"Alex Russell","asCharacter":"Jim Streetas Jim Street"},{"id":"nm2128467","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTE3MGM4NGYtOTg0OS00NjkxLWExODktZjQxYjY0NjRkYzQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ4NDkwMzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lina Esco","asCharacter":"Christina 'Chris' Alonsoas Christina 'Chris' Alonso"},{"id":"nm0425543","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1NDg2NTY0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI5MTAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kenny Johnson","asCharacter":"Dominique Lucaas Dominique Luca"},{"id":"nm0364280","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzOTc2MTY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4NDM4MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jay Harrington","asCharacter":"David 'Deacon' Kayas David 'Deacon' Kay"},{"id":"nm3777479","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGM1MmFlMmMtZDM5Zi00ZThhLTg0NzctY2E1YjcyZTZhYTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI2NjIwMDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Lim","asCharacter":"Victor Tanas Victor Tan"},{"id":"nm0820520","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmFmZjc5NWMtMGUyMy00ZjQ0LWE4NzUtMDQzOWM5NTRiYTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTE2MjI3MzY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick St. Esprit","asCharacter":"Robert Hicksas Robert Hicks"},{"id":"nm2362713","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTcyN2YyOTctNjU1MC00YTExLTg0NjgtZmY5MWJiODg2Yzc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY2MjYyMTI@._V1_Ratio1.9000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephanie Sigman","asCharacter":"Jessica Cortezas Jessica Cortez"},{"id":"nm4609670","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWQxOGUxNmEtYWIwMC00OWFhLTk3MjgtYjE2YTg2OTA0YmYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMxMDIzNTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lou Ferrigno Jr.","asCharacter":"Donovan Rockeras Donovan Rocker…"},{"id":"nm0648846","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0NTM1ODM3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzMwMjk1NDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Onorati","asCharacter":"Jeff Mumfordas Jeff Mumford"},{"id":"nm0268424","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGY1N2NhM2ItNjkyOS00ODkzLTkxZGEtMDM3MzE1ZmE4NDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.1000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Farrington","asCharacter":"Lieutenant Piper Lynchas Lieutenant Piper Lynch"},{"id":"nm7684202","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Deshae Frost","asCharacter":"Darrylas Darryl…"},{"id":"nm0086205","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWJjY2RmZmYtYzA0ZC00ZGVhLWFjOTgtYTZmYTIzYmQyYjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM5NjE3NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Bre Blair","asCharacter":"Annie Kayas Annie Kay…"},{"id":"nm0044762","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxMDQ0NDg5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ2NDEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Obba Babatundé","asCharacter":"Daniel Harrelson, Sr.as Daniel Harrelson, Sr."},{"id":"nm9157143","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzk3MGQ1ZTgtZGFhOS00NDBlLWFjN2YtYjMyZmZhMGMxZmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzcwMTYyNTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Otis Gallop","asCharacter":"S.W.A.T.
