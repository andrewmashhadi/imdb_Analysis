Confused and upset, against the backdrop of a warped perspective and his rapid, heart-rending mental decline, Anthony is starting to lose his grip on reality, struggling to navigate the opaque landscape of present and past. Now, as faded memories and glimpses of lucidity trigger sudden mood swings, dear ones, Anthony's surroundings, and even time itself become distorted. Why has his younger daughter stopped visiting? Who are the strangers that burst in on Anthony?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #131 | Won 2 Oscars, 35 wins & 157 nominations total","directors":"Florian
