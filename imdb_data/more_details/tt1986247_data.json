It's time to find out as four more acts will be moved on to the next round of the $1 million competition. Host Nick Cannon tells Piers Morgan he was \"drinking some Hate-orade\" last night. Piers says he actually got it wrong: He should have buzzed at least two more acts.To the results: The Rhinestone Ropers, Thomas John and Silhouettes are called to the stage. In what must be the least dramatic results revelation of the night, the uber-patriotic Silhouettes must easily be the ones to move on out of this bunch. Right? Right? Asked for her opinion, Sharon even admits it's \"quite obvious\" to her. Sharon even laughs a little as Nick tries to drum up the drama. Thomas John mockingly crosses his fingers just before Nick reveals that Silhouettes are moving on. Piers says he's already excited about what they're going to do in the next round. Be our guest: Hot Chelle Rae stops by to perform its summer hit, \"Tonight, Tonight.\" Later, the touring music and acrobatics show Traces performs, earning a massive standing ovation for showing off some tremendous skills. Back to the results: Steven Retchless, Attack Dance Crew and Geechy Guy are called to the stage and, again, it seems like the result is pretty obvious (this could be a theme tonight. Despite Piers not getting Steven, saying there's a reason there are no male pole dancing clubs, it seems clear that America is on board with Steven. Howie is asked for his thoughts and agrees that America might not \"brace the outrageousness of a male pole dancer.\" Perhaps America is more open minded than expected. Steve Retchless is through to the next round. Sharon urges Steven to just be himself.Next up are Daniel Joseph Baker, Dani Shay and Dylan Andre, and, once again, the choice seems fairly clear. Piers says he wasn't thrilled with Dylan or Dani but that Daniel Joseph Baker should take it. He's right. It's Daniel Joseph Baker. Finally, Smage Bros. Riding Show, Mona Lisa and Landon Swank come to the stage. One of the acts will be dismissed based on votes and that act is ... Mona Lisa. Down to Smage Bros. Riding Show and Landon Swank, the judges have to make the only tough decision of the evening. Sharon is put on the spot first and says Smage Bros. performance was sensational. She says she's been a fan of Landon's from the beginning, but her vote has to go with Smage Bros. Piers says they're very different acts and eventually votes for Landon. The whole decision is left to Howie, who seems uncomfortable. He says the Smage Bros. are very exciting and scary, but Landon Swank has shown him the best illusion he's ever seen, so he is \"truly an amazing act.\" Howie wants to pick both, but since he can't, he has to go with the most exciting thing he saw Tuesday was the Smage Bros., so they're in.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Russell Norman","directorList":[{"id":"nm0635620","name":"Russell Norman"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Dylan Andre, Daniel Joseph Baker, Nick Cannon","starList":[{"id":"nm7246719","name":"Dylan Andre"},{"id":"nm4695731","name":"Daniel Joseph Baker"},{"id":"nm0134244","name":"Nick Cannon"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm7246719","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dylan Andre","asCharacter":"Selfas Self"},{"id":"nm4695731","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Daniel Joseph Baker","asCharacter":"Self - Contestantas Self - Contestant"},{"id":"nm0134244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MDY3MjQxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ2NzE1NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nick Cannon","asCharacter":"Self - Hostas Self - Host"},{"id":"nm0349815","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Geechy Guy","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0005177","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzMDM5ODU4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ5NjQ4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Howie Mandel","asCharacter":"Self - Judgeas Self - Judge"},{"id":"nm0604955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3MTk2MDk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg2MjY2Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Piers Morgan","asCharacter":"Self - Judgeas Self - Judge"},{"id":"nm0651769","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5NDAxOTg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMyMTA3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sharon Osbourne","asCharacter":"Self - Judgeas Self - Judge"},{"id":"nm4686173","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kayla Shen","asCharacter":"Danceras Dancer"},{"id":"nm4621731","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Silhouettes","asCharacter":"Themselvesas Themselves…"},{"id":"nm4621192","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"The Smage Brothers","asCharacter":"Themselvesas Themselves…"},{"id":"nm4621523","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Landon Swank","asCharacter":"Selfas Self…"},{"id":"nm0607636","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kenny Morse","asCharacter":"Rehearsal Howieas Rehearsal Howie"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Game-Show, Music, Reality-TV","genreList":[{"key":"Game-Show","value":"Game-Show"},{"key":"Music","value":"Music"},{"key":"Reality-TV","value":"Reality-TV"}],"companies":"FremantleMedia","companyList":[{"id":"co0035637","name":"FremantleMedia"}],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"6.6","imDbRatingVotes":"28","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0759364","seriesTitle":"America's Got Talent","seriesFullTitle":"America's Got Talent (TV Series 2006– )","seriesYear":"2006","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"6","episodeNumber":"17","previousEpisodeId":"tt1986246","nextEpisodeId":"tt1986248"},"errorMessage":null}
