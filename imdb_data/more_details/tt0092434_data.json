But raising 5 girls is far from easy; they keep him on the edge of his last nerve. When things go awry, he starts to take notice of them as people instead of a group. He soon changes his mind about the school and decides to keep them around permanently, and he tries to smooth out his rough edges to become a role-model parent, which takes much time and love. The girls go through their own troubles as they adapt to a having an adult who is actually trying. Used to being on their own, they make a lot of adult decisions without asking Nick, from buying a food truck to making a trek to Vegas to retrieve Elvis' guitar, and putting themselves often at risk. Nick is there to save the day, and the girls always learn valuable life lessons. Set in 1961, this Family Musical Dramedy features period songs rewritten to fit plotlines, and is one show not to miss. Musical Dramady one not to miss.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 2 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Joseph Bologna,
