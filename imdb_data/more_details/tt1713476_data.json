During the town's annual 4th of July Crab Festival, townspeople become sick, exhibiting a variety of symptoms, which leads local news reporters to suspect something has infected the water there. No one is sure what it is or how it's transmitted, but as people start to behave strangely, and others turning up dead, fear spawns into panic. The town is shut down as government authorities confiscate video footage from every media or personal source they find, in an effort to cover-up the incident. But one local reporter who witnessed the epidemic, was able to document, assemble, and hide this film in hopes that one day, the horrible truth would be revealed . . .","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 1 nomination","directors":"Barry Levinson","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001469","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"writers":"Michael Wallach, Barry Levinson","writerList":[{"id":"nm4057720","name":"Michael Wallach"},{"id":"nm0001469","name":"Barry Levinson"}],"stars":"Will Rogers, Kristen Connolly, Kether Donohue","starList":[{"id":"nm3283577","name":"Will Rogers"},{"id":"nm1393354","name":"Kristen Connolly"},{"id":"nm1850967","name":"Kether Donohue"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3283577","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjE4ZWQ4NzAtYzRjZC00ZjUyLTlhMDEtN2ZjMGE0N2JhMzVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM4NDM4ODk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Will Rogers","asCharacter":"Alexas Alex"},{"id":"nm1393354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5NzA4OTY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI5MjY1NjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kristen Connolly","asCharacter":"Stephanieas Stephanie"},{"id":"nm1850967","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcxMjQwNzUzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY4OTk0MzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kether Donohue","asCharacter":"Donnaas Donna"},{"id":"nm1478067","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzc3OWI0OGQtMDk2Ni00YjczLWJkYWEtZTdlMzRhNmQ1YjM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frank Deal","asCharacter":"Mayor Stockmanas Mayor Stockman"},{"id":"nm1863607","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2RhOGQ4MTktZjBiZS00OTY3LTg1MjYtNWZjMWRmZmNmNzVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nansi Aluka","asCharacter":"Jaqulineas Jaquline"},{"id":"nm1706832","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjE4NDQ2NjEwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUwMDAwMTE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Denham","asCharacter":"Samas Sam"},{"id":"nm0475218","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwOTcwODI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTczNjY3MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Kunken","asCharacter":"Dr. Abramsas Dr. Abrams"},{"id":"nm2906942","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kimberly Campbell","asCharacter":"Nurse Rebeccaas Nurse Rebecca"},{"id":"nm4082924","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Beckett Clayton-Luce","asCharacter":"Charlesas Charles"},{"id":"nm0353491","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dave Hager","asCharacter":"Fisher Jerryas Fisher Jerry"},{"id":"nm3508628","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGM2ZGQ5YTgtNmNmNy00ZTU4LTk5ZTgtMGYyMGFmNWM5ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTAwMzUyMzUy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tara Polhemus","asCharacter":"Teenage Girlas Teenage Girl"},{"id":"nm2300874","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sean Johnson","asCharacter":"Teenage Boyas Teenage Boy"},{"id":"nm5416029","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Murat Erdan","asCharacter":"Mike Radio Hostas Mike Radio Host"},{"id":"nm0422510","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzMjQ3NDQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyNzgyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lamya Jezek","asCharacter":"Ms. Rosenblattas Ms. Rosenblatt"},{"id":"nm0287166","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjU1YjZjODEtMmIzNi00N2I0LTgxMDItZDIzNzY2MmExN2ZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3NDg4OTY@._V1_Ratio1.6143_AL_.jpg","name":"Lucia Scarano","asCharacter":"Marla Spadaforaas Marla Spadafora"},{"id":"nm4709790","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjE2MWFmMjItMjEyZi00NmU3LWFmZDItYTdhYzE2NmI0ZmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjgzOTY3NDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stacy Rabon","asCharacter":"Middle Age Womanas Middle Age Woman"},{"id":"nm5416019","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Charles Weaver","asCharacter":"Water Rescue Workeras Water Rescue Worker"},{"id":"nm5416054","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Keyla S.
