Its British counterpart, Hadrian's Wall, had a short-lived northern-more version, Antonin's Wall. Modern research sees it less as a military rampart to defend as such then a symbol of imperial power and basis for regular patrols and sorties, on horseback or by surprisingly fast row and sail boat. Still it couldn't stop the major Germanic migrations.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0326706","seriesTitle":"Schliemanns Erben","seriesFullTitle":"Schliemanns Erben (TV Series 1996â€“ )","seriesYear":"1996","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"8","episodeNumber":"1","previousEpisodeId":"tt1204213","nextEpisodeId":"tt1418373"},"errorMessage":null}
