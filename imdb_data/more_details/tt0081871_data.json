A startled Ralph is soon visited by aliens, who had decided to endow him with superhuman powers to fight the battle against injustice and crime. To this end, they gave him a special suit and an instruction manual. Unfortunately, Ralph managed to lose the instruction manual, and the aliens have a nasty habit of never being around when you need them.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 4 Primetime Emmys, 1 win & 8 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"William Katt, Connie Sellecca, Robert Culp","starList":[{"id":"nm0001411","name":"William Katt"},{"id":"nm0783314","name":"Connie Sellecca"},{"id":"nm0191685","name":"Robert Culp"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001411","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTJhNjNkZmQtMDExMi00YmZkLWExZDYtNzNmYzg2ZTRmZTQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTYxMTg5Mjk@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"William Katt","asCharacter":"Ralph Hinkleyas Ralph Hinkley"},{"id":"nm0783314","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIyOTMzODc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzQxNzQxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Connie Sellecca","asCharacter":"Pam Davidsonas Pam Davidson…"},{"id":"nm0191685","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1NDg3NDMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU3MTgyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Culp","asCharacter":"Bill Maxwellas Bill Maxwell"},{"id":"nm0001595","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDAzNDQxNjI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA1OTE3NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Paré","asCharacter":"Tony Villicanaas Tony Villicana"},{"id":"nm0002109","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODY5NTQwMTc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg3OTMyNTE@._V1_Ratio1.1429_AL_.jpg","name":"Faye Grant","asCharacter":"Rhonda Blakeas Rhonda Blake"},{"id":"nm0324795","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ2NDA3MzkxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzOTQyNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jesse D.
