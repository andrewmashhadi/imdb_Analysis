It may be the fantasy of most boys that age but Jamie has the talent to make his dreams come true. If only he could control his temper and stop being so distracted by everything else going on in his life. When Jamie's dad vanished off the face of the earth he and his mum were forced to move and now Jamie has to start at a rough new school mid term. He becomes friends with a girl called Jack who shares his passion for football and can also give him a good run for his money in terms of skill. He also befriends Boggy, a boy with theatrical leanings who deflects the bullies cruel jibes with his quick wit. When Jamie becomes preoccupied with trying to track down his absent father it looks like he's about to squander his chances of ever getting picked for the school team, and when he discovers a terrible truth about the man he has always worshipped it has the potential to crush him, but Jamie fights back the only way he knows how - with a football at his feet.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Louis Dunn, Jonnie Kimmins, Patrick Ward","starList":[{"id":"nm8124489","name":"Louis Dunn"},{"id":"nm6687697","name":"Jonnie Kimmins"},{"id":"nm9756732","name":"Patrick Ward"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm8124489","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Louis Dunn","asCharacter":"Jamie Johnsonas Jamie Johnson…"},{"id":"nm6687697","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jonnie Kimmins","asCharacter":"Boggyas Boggy"},{"id":"nm9756732","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Patrick Ward","asCharacter":"Dillonas Dillon…"},{"id":"nm0200579","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tim Dantay","asCharacter":"Mike Johnsonas Mike Johnson"},{"id":"nm9756733","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maddie Murchison","asCharacter":"Zoeas Zoe…"},{"id":"nm8908770","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lenna Gunning Williams","asCharacter":"Jackas Jack…"},{"id":"nm0822697","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTU2M2E3YzYtNjIwZC00NmI1LTk3YzQtYjIwMzVlMDVjOWNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMyMjQzMjU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emma Stansfield","asCharacter":"Karen Johnsonas Karen Johnson…"},{"id":"nm10644805","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Keaton Edmund","asCharacter":"Freddieas Freddie…"},{"id":"nm10644804","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elena Cole","asCharacter":"Albaas Alba…"},{"id":"nm0100598","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Brian Bovell","asCharacter":"Mr. Hansardas Mr. Hansard"},{"id":"nm10644806","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Morgan Hudson","asCharacter":"Ericas Eric…"},{"id":"nm10644807","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Zoe Hall","asCharacter":"Rubyas Ruby…"},{"id":"nm0817527","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyOTQwMjA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzYxMzMzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lucy Speed","asCharacter":"Ms R.
