His experiences in the chamber cause him to hallucinate, much of the imagery being religious-based although he's not religious. Seven years later, he is a respected full professor in the Harvard Medical School. Believing he has lost his edge and fallen into an unwanted state of respectability, Eddie decides to resume his work with sensory deprivation, this time using hallucinogens, specifically untested ones used in mystical Mexican rituals, to enhance the isolation-take experience. After initial tests, he claims he entered an alternate physical and mental state. Although unbelieving of Eddie's claims, his colleagues Arthur Rosenberg and Mason Parrish, as well as Eddie's wife Emily, herself a respected academic, are concerned for Eddie's well being. However, if Eddie's claims are indeed true, he could do irreparable harm to himself and others around him, especially if his altered states are uncontrollable.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 1 win & 7 nominations total","directors":"Ken Russell","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001692","name":"Ken Russell"}],"writers":"Paddy Chayefsky","writerList":[{"id":"nm0154665","name":"Paddy Chayefsky"}],"stars":"William Hurt, Blair Brown, Bob Balaban","starList":[{"id":"nm0000458","name":"William Hurt"},{"id":"nm0001974","name":"Blair Brown"},{"id":"nm0000837","name":"Bob Balaban"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000458","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyNzA5MTUxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Hurt","asCharacter":"Eddie Jessupas Eddie Jessup"},{"id":"nm0001974","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODg1MDYxNjYyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTY4MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Blair Brown","asCharacter":"Emily Jessupas Emily Jessup"},{"id":"nm0000837","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4ODkzNTMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk5ODk4Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Balaban","asCharacter":"Arthur Rosenbergas Arthur Rosenberg"},{"id":"nm0354024","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzJhNDVlMmYtOTkzNi00OWQwLWI5MjEtYTVkNTU5ZjhmYzNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Haid","asCharacter":"Mason Parrishas Mason Parrish"},{"id":"nm0671837","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTUzMGViY2EtNzIyNC00MmI3LTk0YWUtZDRkMzNlNDcxN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg3MzYyMzY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Thaao Penghlis","asCharacter":"Eccheverriaas Eccheverria"},{"id":"nm0324196","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Miguel Godreau","asCharacter":"Primal Manas Primal Man"},{"id":"nm0107467","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dori Brenner","asCharacter":"Sylvia Rosenbergas Sylvia Rosenberg"},{"id":"nm0104793","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Brandon","asCharacter":"Hobartas Hobart"},{"id":"nm0925618","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOThjZTk3OTItMjgyZS00NGY4LTgxYzItZmYwOGIxM2FjYjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles White-Eagle","asCharacter":"The Brujoas The Brujo"},{"id":"nm0000106","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEyOTMzODIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODM2NTY5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Drew Barrymore","asCharacter":"Margaret Jessupas Margaret Jessup"},{"id":"nm0420158","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Megan Jeffers","asCharacter":"Grace Jessupas Grace Jessup"},{"id":"nm0613789","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDJiNmI0OTktNWRmMS00YjBiLTlmNzItMTg1Y2MzODU2N2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI2MDEwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Murdock","asCharacter":"Hector Ortecoas Hector Orteco"},{"id":"nm0565133","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzE5OTg2MzA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc3NDM1Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Francis X.
