Unable to suddenly repay his friend's huge debt all by himself, Kaiji is offered a shady deal to participate in an illegal underground gamble on a cruise ship. This turns out to be nothing more than the beginning of his new life of hell-thrown headlong into a life-threatening roller coaster of mind games, cheating, and deceit. Based on the first entry of the famous gambling manga series by Nobuyuki Fukumoto, Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor follows our unlucky protagonist as he is forced to fight not only other people, but also the mysteries of their psyches. Kaiji finds out the hard way that the worst sides of human nature surface when people's backs are against the wall, and that the most fearsome dangers of all are greed, paranoia, and the human survival instinct itself.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Masato Hagiwara, Hakuryû, Naoya Uchida","starList":[{"id":"nm0353717","name":"Masato Hagiwara"},{"id":"nm0354653","name":"Hakuryû"},{"id":"nm0998211","name":"Naoya Uchida"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0353717","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Masato Hagiwara","asCharacter":"Kaiji Itôas Kaiji Itô"},{"id":"nm0354653","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTE2MWQ4YjEtNjRhZC00MWE5LTg3MjktNTE0YzA2ZDQ1YmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.8571_AL_.jpg","name":"Hakuryû","asCharacter":"Tonegawaas Tonegawa"},{"id":"nm0998211","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Naoya Uchida","asCharacter":"Endôas Endô"},{"id":"nm0411050","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hideo Ishikawa","asCharacter":"Funaias Funai"},{"id":"nm0407527","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hiroshi Yanaka","asCharacter":"Ishidaas Ishida"},{"id":"nm1697606","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjJkYzkyOGYtNDg0ZS00MjBmLWI1MTQtYjNlZTEwZDlkZjI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Yûichi Nakamura","asCharacter":"Participant Aas Participant A"},{"id":"nm0846192","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjliMDY4OWItNjBhNi00ZmIyLWIwMDQtZThmZWQ5ZjQ5N2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQxNjcxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fumihiko Tachiki","asCharacter":"Narratoras Narrator"},{"id":"nm0476415","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Taiten Kusunoki","asCharacter":"Black Suit Aas Black Suit A…"},{"id":"nm2278068","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yôichi Nishjima","asCharacter":"Black Suit Cas Black Suit C"},{"id":"nm1670250","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kunihiro Kawamoto","asCharacter":"Black Suit Bas Black Suit B"},{"id":"nm2239419","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yukitoshi Tokumoto","asCharacter":"Participant Cas Participant C"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Thriller","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Thriller","value":"Thriller"}],"companies":"D.N.
