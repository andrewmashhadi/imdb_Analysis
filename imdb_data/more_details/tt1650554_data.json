When these amateur superheroes are hunted down by Red Mist -- reborn as The Mother F%&*^r -- only the blade-wielding Hit Girl can prevent their annihilation. When we last saw junior assassin Hit Girl and young vigilante Kick-Ass, they were trying to live as normal teenagers Mindy and Dave. With graduation looming and uncertain what to do, Dave decides to start the world's first superhero team with Mindy. Unfortunately, when Mindy is busted for sneaking out as Hit Girl, she's forced to retire-leaving her to navigate the terrifying world of high-school mean girls on her own. With no one left to turn to, Dave joins forces with Justice Forever, run by a born-again ex-mobster named Colonel Stars and Stripes. Just as they start to make a real difference on the streets, the world's first super villain, The Mother F%&*^r, assembles his own evil league and puts a plan in motion to make Kick-Ass and Hit Girl pay for what they did to his dad. But there's only one problem with his scheme: If you mess with one member of Justice Forever, you mess with them all.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 9 nominations","directors":"Jeff Wadlow","directorList":[{"id":"nm0905592","name":"Jeff Wadlow"}],"writers":"Jeff Wadlow, Mark Millar, John Romita Jr.","writerList":[{"id":"nm0905592","name":"Jeff Wadlow"},{"id":"nm2092839","name":"Mark Millar"},{"id":"nm1348210","name":"John Romita Jr."}],"stars":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Chloë Grace Moretz, Christopher Mintz-Plasse","starList":[{"id":"nm1093951","name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson"},{"id":"nm1631269","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz"},{"id":"nm2395586","name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1093951","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzE5MzI0MzY2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE3MTk4MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson","asCharacter":"Dave Lizewskias Dave Lizewski…"},{"id":"nm1631269","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA5MzE2NzA2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTc1NDA4NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz","asCharacter":"Mindy Macreadyas Mindy Macready…"},{"id":"nm2395586","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyNjUzMDk5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk0Nzk5Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse","asCharacter":"Chris D'Amicoas Chris D'Amico…"},{"id":"nm0000120","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwMjAwNzI0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY1MTMyOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Carrey","asCharacter":"Colonel Stars and Stripesas Colonel Stars and Stripes"},{"id":"nm0004820","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDYzNDQzMTkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTYwNDQyMDI@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Morris Chestnut","asCharacter":"Detective Marcus Williamsas Detective Marcus Williams"},{"id":"nm4932304","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjg2YTZlOGUtMmFhNi00ODA5LTkzN2EtMTNjZjE0NGMzZWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjAyOTk0OTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Claudia Lee","asCharacter":"Brookeas Brooke"},{"id":"nm0031750","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTJmYzNlYTEtNDlhNC00NjFhLTkyMzQtMDc2NjYxNjM2OTUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDA0MzY2OTA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Anzel","asCharacter":"Mrs. Zaneas Mrs. Zane"},{"id":"nm0241173","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2U4ZTY4MTktNTE1Zi00ZDhkLTlhZjMtMDk3NDBkNTllNWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQzMTY4ODA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Clark Duke","asCharacter":"Martyas Marty…"},{"id":"nm1167083","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlhNDEwZmEtMDgwZC00YmI1LThlNDctOTdjNGM2ZGRjM2IxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIwNTk0Mzk@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Augustus Prew","asCharacter":"Toddas Todd…"},{"id":"nm2050714","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDExMDEwYWUtYTMyYy00ZGRhLTk0NDctOGNkZGEwOTM0NzY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg1NjA0Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Kitchen","asCharacter":"News Reporteras News Reporter"},{"id":"nm0265668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1NDQ2MzA2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ0MzUwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Donald Faison","asCharacter":"Dr. Gravityas Dr. Gravity"},{"id":"nm2491398","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Matt Steinberg","asCharacter":"Mr. Radicalas Mr. Radical"},{"id":"nm0533599","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM3OTgyNGYtOGE2Ni00OTg1LWE0ZDEtOTlhYzQ2MWJlZThhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDI2OTQ0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Steven Mackintosh","asCharacter":"Tommy's Dadas Tommy's Dad"},{"id":"nm0230826","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjA3NTk3MzkxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1NzkyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Monica Dolan","asCharacter":"Tommy's Mumas Tommy's Mum"},{"id":"nm0113595","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxMjE4NTgwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc5ODg2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Garrett M.
