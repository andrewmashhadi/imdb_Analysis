Mr Bing, is going to make something of his life, be a provider for his childhood sweetheart Bernadette and his young son Joe. There's just one problem: Bing thinks his tendency for gambling is going to let him do so. If there's money for betting, he'll find it...and frequently loses it. And he's always sorry. Until the next time. Yet for all his failings, Bernadette loves him. And as for Joe, well there's always Grandad George to cheer him on at football matches when his Dad's down the bookies. However, when Bing's gambling spirals out of control, his losses loom large - the only thing left to lose is his family. Suddenly his whole world is at risk. How can he win back all that he's lost?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Steve Coogan, Bernard Hill, Lisa
