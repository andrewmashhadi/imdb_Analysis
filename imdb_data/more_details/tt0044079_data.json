His plan is relatively simple: Two strangers each agree to kill someone the other person wants gone. For example, Guy could kill his father and he could get rid of Guy's wife Miriam, freeing him to marry Anne Morton, the beautiful daughter of a U.S. Senator. Guy dismisses it all out of hand, but Bruno goes ahead with his half of the \"bargain\" and disposes of Miriam. When Guy balks, Bruno makes it clear that he will plant evidence to implicate Guy in her murder if he doesn't get rid of his father. Guy had also made some unfortunate statements about Miriam after she had refused to divorce him. It all leads the police to believe Guy is responsible for the murder, forcing him to deal with Bruno's mad ravings.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 3 wins & 2 nominations total","directors":"Alfred Hitchcock","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000033","name":"Alfred Hitchcock"}],"writers":"Raymond Chandler, Czenzi Ormonde, Whitfield Cook","writerList":[{"id":"nm0151452","name":"Raymond Chandler"},{"id":"nm0650262","name":"Czenzi Ormonde"},{"id":"nm0177336","name":"Whitfield Cook"}],"stars":"Farley Granger, Robert Walker, Ruth Roman","starList":[{"id":"nm0335048","name":"Farley Granger"},{"id":"nm0908153","name":"Robert Walker"},{"id":"nm0738746","name":"Ruth Roman"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0335048","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzODIwNzc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzMTM4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Farley Granger","asCharacter":"Guy Hainesas Guy Haines"},{"id":"nm0908153","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI3NDI5NzA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDU3NTMxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Walker","asCharacter":"Bruno Antonyas Bruno Antony"},{"id":"nm0738746","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjcyMDA1MjAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjcwOTgxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ruth Roman","asCharacter":"Anne Mortonas Anne Morton"},{"id":"nm0001991","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzA3MzE0NDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA2MjYwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Leo G.
