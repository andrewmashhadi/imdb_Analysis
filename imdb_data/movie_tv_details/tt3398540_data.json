Determined to become like the championship's star player, a short boy nicknamed \"the small giant\", Shouyou joined his school's volleyball club. Unfortunately, he was the only member and the club didn't have so much as a place to practice. He didn't let that deter him, however, and, upon finally acquiring 5 other players in his final year, was able to compete in an actual competition - only for his team to be unlucky enough to face the championship favorite and its star player, Kageyama Tobio, called \"the king of the court\", in the first round. Though Shouyou's team suffers a crushing defeat, he vows to become better and eventually surpass Kageyama. Now Shouyou is starting his first year in high school - the very one he had first watched in the national championships. He's going to join the volleyball team, practice constantly, and wipe the floor with Kageyama the next time they meet on the court. ...or at least that's what Shouyou had planned, until he discovers that he and Kageyama are now in the same school. The volleyball team definitely needs their skills, but only if they can stop bickering and learn to work together as teammates.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #134 |
