Now newer medications are emerging, thanks to advances in science. Research has brought about a better understanding of cancer on a molecular level. This understanding is resulting in medicines that zero in on properties unique to cancer cells, allowing those medicines to selectively affect cancer with the potential of less collateral damage to healthy cells in the body. This episode, \"Targeted Cancer Therapy,\" describes how targeted therapies work, and introduces patients and families who are finding hope and healing where there once was none.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Bob Buruchian","directorList":[{"id":"nm2548370","name":"Bob Buruchian"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Documentary, News","genreList":[{"key":"Documentary","value":"Documentary"},{"key":"News","value":"News"}],"companies":"Information Television Network","companyList":[{"id":"co0047032","name":"Information Television Network"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt1182444","seriesTitle":"Healthy Body, Healthy Mind","seriesFullTitle":"Healthy Body, Healthy Mind (TV Series 2003â€“ )","seriesYear":"2003","seriesYearEnd":"","seasonNumber":"6","episodeNumber":"5","previousEpisodeId":"tt1192976","nextEpisodeId":"tt1192975"},"errorMessage":null}
