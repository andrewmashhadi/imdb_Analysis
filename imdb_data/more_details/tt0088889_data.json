In \"Quitters, Inc.\": the cat is picked up by a shady New York City \"doctor\" who uses experimental techniques to get people to quit smoking. His latest client is a man named Morrison, who learns he'll suffer some terrible consequences if he tries to cheat. In \"The Ledge\": the cat is picked up by Cressner, a shady Atlantic City millionaire who forces tennis pro Norris (his wife's lover), to walk a narrow ledge around his high-rise penthouse apartment. In \"The General\": the cat arrives in Wilmington, North Carolina, where it is found by Amanda, the young girl it has been sent to protect. What she needs protection from is a tiny, evil troll who lives behind the skirting board in her bedroom.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 nominations","directors":"Lewis
