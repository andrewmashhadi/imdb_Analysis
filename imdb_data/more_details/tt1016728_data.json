He finds out that she's given her mother marching orders after she told her she was \"mutton dressed up as lamb.\" Griffiths, with Rod, scratches his head over how they get through so many supplies of plates and cleaning fluid. Aichaa avoids Robbie, until he finally catches her in the library. Still showing the signs of the weekend's struggle, she tells him it is hopeless, her father would never understand. Mauler - or rather \"Francis\"- watches Rod's suspicious activity with much interest. Unable to give Walt the compensation for the broken eggs, Rod gives him some school supplies - floor polish and washing-up liquid.

They break through the fence, and use the electronic key to gain entry into the animal house. Her hand on one of the cages, Calley argues with Ronnie, who's being rather superior about animal rights. When a monkey scratches her hand, she withdraws it in a hurry. Ronnie uses her camera to take some photos of the cages. Outside, a new security guard arrives, with a trained dog, and the two head towards to the entry area. Sitting down to drink some tea, one of the guards notices activity on the closed-circuit TV - the guards head off to investigate, and at the same time, the girls notice the camera operating, and make a run for it. In the darkness, they are confused and can't find the broken fence, and they are cornered by the guards, the dog barking ferociously...","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Riitta-Leena Lynn","directorList":[{"id":"nm2127948","name":"Riitta-Leena Lynn"}],"writers":"Kevin Hood, Phil Redmond","writerList":[{"id":"nm0393495","name":"Kevin Hood"},{"id":"nm0715087","name":"Phil Redmond"}],"stars":"John Alford, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Sarah Butler","starList":[{"id":"nm0019212","name":"John Alford"},{"id":"nm0004355","name":"Roger Ashton-Griffiths"},{"id":"nm2794101","name":"Sarah Butler"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0019212","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Alford","asCharacter":"Robbie Wrightas Robbie Wright"},{"id":"nm0004355","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTcyZWFjZjItYmI4NS00ZDE2LTg4Y2YtYWJkYWI5MWJlNWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk3NTUyOTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Roger Ashton-Griffiths","asCharacter":"Waltas Walt"},{"id":"nm2794101","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sarah Butler","asCharacter":"Pupilas Pupil"},{"id":"nm0498505","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ian Congdon","asCharacter":"Ted Fiskas Ted Fisk"},{"id":"nm0178058","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjY2Y2NlNDQtMjU4Ni00ZTgyLWE4MTgtYzdhN2YwNzZjMjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"George A.
