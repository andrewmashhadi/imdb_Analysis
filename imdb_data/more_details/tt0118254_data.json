Ally even followed Billy to Harvard law school despite having no interest in law. But when Billy chose to pursue a career in law away from Ally, their relationship came to an end. In the present, an old classmate of Ally's named Richard Fish gives Ally a job at his law firm, where Billy and his new wife are also working. This puts Ally in a predicament since she still has feelings for Billy which she's laboring to get over. At the office, Ally puts up with a nosy, gossiping secretary named Elaine, and an oddball lawyer named John Cage never seems to lose a case. At home, Ally's friend and house-mate Renée regularly advises her on her love life. The series follows Ally's trials and tribulations in life through her eyes, and caricaturizes her personal thoughts and fantasies.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 7 Primetime Emmys, 43 wins & 115 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Calista Flockhart, Greg Germann, Jane Krakowski","starList":[{"id":"nm0001222","name":"Calista Flockhart"},{"id":"nm0314524","name":"Greg Germann"},{"id":"nm0005105","name":"Jane Krakowski"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001222","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxMzQ1NDM5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzAyNzMxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Calista Flockhart","asCharacter":"Ally McBealas Ally McBeal"},{"id":"nm0314524","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwNjA3MDMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjAxMTUz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Greg Germann","asCharacter":"Richard Fishas Richard Fish"},{"id":"nm0005105","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwODAyNjY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDc5NDky._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jane Krakowski","asCharacter":"Elaine Vassalas Elaine Vassal"},{"id":"nm0005423","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5NTM3MTgwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTgwNjE2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vonda Shepard","asCharacter":"Vonda Shepardas Vonda Shepard"},{"id":"nm0001493","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODExNDExYTQtYjliZS00YzY4LWJmYmItYWE0ZDNjNGM0Mzc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTYxNDAyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter MacNicol","asCharacter":"John Cageas John Cage"},{"id":"nm0004808","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1NzEzMjAxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODIxMDA0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lisa Nicole Carson","asCharacter":"Renee Raddickas Renee Raddick"},{"id":"nm0005577","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0Mjk1MjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyNjY5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Portia de Rossi","asCharacter":"Nelle Porteras Nelle Porter"},{"id":"nm0005154","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTgxODE0MjI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxMzMzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lucy Liu","asCharacter":"Ling Wooas Ling Woo"},{"id":"nm0005489","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4NzE2NjAwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTQzODMz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Courtney Thorne-Smith","asCharacter":"Georgia Thomasas Georgia Thomas"},{"id":"nm0004743","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxMzc0MDAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzUzMTI0MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gil Bellows","asCharacter":"Billy Thomasas Billy Thomas"},{"id":"nm0355278","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwOTY2Mjk3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzYxMjgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Hall","asCharacter":"Judge Seymore Walshas Judge Seymore Walsh"},{"id":"nm0325989","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5MjAwNDExM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk0NjUyOTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Renée Elise Goldsberry","asCharacter":"Singeras Singer…"},{"id":"nm1219070","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Vatrena King","asCharacter":"Singeras Singer…"},{"id":"nm1106426","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyNDkyMDY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUxOTUyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sy Smith","asCharacter":"Singeras Singer…"},{"id":"nm0001457","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2I5MDQ4MDItNDc2Zi00NmExLThhZmUtMDYyM2ZmMmU4NWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA3NDkwMDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Le Gros","asCharacter":"Mark Albertas Mark Albert"},{"id":"nm0356021","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5NjUyNjk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwMTYwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Regina Hall","asCharacter":"Corretta Lippas Corretta Lipp"},{"id":"nm0000375","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzg1MTUyNDYxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ4MTE2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Downey Jr.","asCharacter":"Larry Paulas Larry Paul"},{"id":"nm0005020","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAzNDMyNDM3MTVeQTJeQWpwZ15BcmVzdW1l._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Hopkins","asCharacter":"Raymond Millburyas Raymond Millbury"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"}],"companies":"20th Century Fox Television, David E.
