The enter a windowless room and an Invigilator gives them 80 minutes to answer one simple question. He outlines three rules they must obey or be disqualified: don't talk to him or the armed guard by the door, don't spoil their papers, and don't leave the room. He starts the clock and leaves. The candidates turn over their question papers--and discovers that they're completely blank. After the initial confusion has subsided, one frustrated candidate writes 'I believe I deserve...,' and is promptly ejected for spoiling. The remaining candidates soon figure out they're permitted to talk to each other, and they agree to cooperate in order to figure out the question: then they can compete to answer it. At first they suspect the question may be hidden in their papers like a security marker in a credit card, and they figure out ways to change their environment to expose the hidden words. But light, liquids and other plans all come to naught. Soon enough, the candidates begin to uncover one another's backgrounds, prejudices, and hidden agendas. Tensions rise as the clock steadily descends towards zero, and each candidate must decide how far they are willing to go to secure the ultimate job . . .","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 2 wins & 2 nominations total","directors":"Stuart Hazeldine","directorList":[{"id":"nm0371955","name":"Stuart Hazeldine"}],"writers":"Stuart Hazeldine, Simon Garrity","writerList":[{"id":"nm0371955","name":"Stuart Hazeldine"},{"id":"nm3089840","name":"Simon Garrity"}],"stars":"Adar Beck, Gemma Chan, Nathalie Cox","starList":[{"id":"nm3065862","name":"Adar Beck"},{"id":"nm2110418","name":"Gemma Chan"},{"id":"nm1812523","name":"Nathalie Cox"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3065862","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmM4YTQ2ZDQtMTUwOC00M2Y2LWEzNmQtMWZjNWY2ZmExN2FkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_Ratio2.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Adar Beck","asCharacter":"Darkas Dark"},{"id":"nm2110418","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTI3ZDEwYjktZjVhYS00NTlhLTkwOWEtNjM1MzEyMWU5M2QyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE3ODY2Nzk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gemma Chan","asCharacter":"Chinese Girlas Chinese Girl"},{"id":"nm1812523","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODY1ODRkN2MtNzQ1YS00MTE1LWFiMTMtNTY0MDYyYThiZjQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk5MTE3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nathalie Cox","asCharacter":"Blondeas Blonde"},{"id":"nm1125878","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGNiYmQ2ODUtZWNjOS00YmNlLWEyYzktMDhhOGIwODg2MWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDkyNTQyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Lloyd Fillingham","asCharacter":"Deafas Deaf"},{"id":"nm1030244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTBlZWZlYmYtMTEzZi00OTU5LWEzYWQtYjJjZjBmZWJkOTUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk4NTI2NTI@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chukwudi Iwuji","asCharacter":"Blackas Black"},{"id":"nm1717573","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwMjA5OTc5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM5ODk4MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pollyanna McIntosh","asCharacter":"Brunetteas Brunette"},{"id":"nm0531101","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTA3MjE2NmYtNDcwZC00NjE1LWI2ZGItYzFlODI3OGY5NjI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQyNzMyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Luke Mably","asCharacter":"Whiteas White"},{"id":"nm0592993","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwNTY2ODIxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzQ2NjI4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jimi Mistry","asCharacter":"Brownas Brown"},{"id":"nm0758760","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTkxOTY0NTAwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg2MzM2NzE@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Colin Salmon","asCharacter":"The Invigilatoras The Invigilator"},{"id":"nm1362415","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Carey","asCharacter":"The Guardas The Guard"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Mystery, Thriller","genreList":[{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"},{"key":"Thriller","value":"Thriller"}],"companies":"Hazeldine Films, Bedlam Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0242010","name":"Hazeldine Films"},{"id":"co0095111","name":"Bedlam Productions"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English, French, Cantonese","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"Cantonese","value":"Cantonese"}],"contentRating":"Not Rated","imDbRating":"6.8","imDbRatingVotes":"113525","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$394,717"},"tagline":"80 minutes -
