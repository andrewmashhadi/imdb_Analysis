Vyvyan, Rick, Mike, and Neil pay their rent to their Russian landlord Jerzy Balowski (Alexei Sayle) and his various family members. The world of this show is surreal, hilarious, and violent as the show also interacts with other characters, and featured live performances from bands.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 BAFTA Award, 1 win & 1 nomination total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Rik Mayall, Adrian
