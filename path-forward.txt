GENERAL FLOW OF PAPER

BACKGROUND
...

DATA COLLECTIONS AND CLEANING
- Briefly discuss methods of data gathering and storing (api, html/xpaths, json locally, RDS for analysis)
   

MOTIVE

Execs want to make a movie, we present our options with 3 paths:
- Gross box office route (monetary focused) -- predictive modeling using random forest and comparing with lm 
- ImdbRating route (award focused) -- predictive modeling using ranodm forest and comparing with lm
- Execs might have certain movies in mind -- we could use unsupervised for a recommendation system to present
  them with similar movies, and then focus on the details of those similar movies

SECTION (1) 

- ImDbRating predictions
- GrossboxOffice predictions (CPI adjusted) 
- random forests (with feature importance plots), lm's, etc. 
  (make sure to display plots used to optimize/tune the hyperparameters)
- use models with Dylan's additional numeric variables
- compare different models predictive values with MSE (K-fold CV) and prediction accuracy and R^2
- exploratory data analysis with Dan's plots (used to support findings of the models, and for more fluff)
- ...


SECTION (2) 

- Clustering results (k-means with k-modes)
- Unsupervised learning plots
- examples using the recommendation system with the KNN algorithm
- continue cleaning/working on exising or new plots, and attempt to use the extended dataset 
- we need to provide examples and something to talk about (mentioned from Prof Zes)
