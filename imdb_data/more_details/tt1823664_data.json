Abandoned by her biological parents as a baby, Annie (Wallis) spends every moment of every day attempting to avoid the wrath of her cruel foster mother Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Thing start to look up for Annie, however, when she has a very public encounter with Will Stacks (Foxx), a local cell-phone mogul with mayoral ambitions. Stacks' campaign isn't going too well until he meets Annie and invites her into his home at the suggestion of his trusted top assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) and his ambitious PR advisor Guy (Bobby Cannavale). Meanwhile, what was originally conceived as a PR stunt to win over skeptical voters becomes something much more personal when the jaded tycoon realizes his little friend is much more than a mere good-luck charm.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 wins & 18 nominations","directors":"Will Gluck","directorList":[{"id":"nm0323239","name":"Will Gluck"}],"writers":"Will Gluck, Aline Brosh McKenna, Thomas Meehan","writerList":[{"id":"nm0323239","name":"Will Gluck"},{"id":"nm0112459","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna"},{"id":"nm0576070","name":"Thomas Meehan"}],"stars":"Quvenzhané Wallis, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx","starList":[{"id":"nm4832920","name":"Quvenzhané Wallis"},{"id":"nm0000139","name":"Cameron Diaz"},{"id":"nm0004937","name":"Jamie Foxx"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm4832920","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1ZDQwNDctMDA5OC00ODdmLWJjNWYtNTcxNTFlOWFlYzQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNzQzMDE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Quvenzhané Wallis","asCharacter":"Annieas Annie"},{"id":"nm0000139","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxNTI5NzM4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI3ODY3Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cameron Diaz","asCharacter":"Hanniganas Hannigan"},{"id":"nm0004937","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyNjY1NDg3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2MTg0MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jamie Foxx","asCharacter":"Will Stacksas Will Stacks"},{"id":"nm0126284","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0MDA2Njc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzc3NDU3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rose Byrne","asCharacter":"Graceas Grace"},{"id":"nm0134072","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NzM3MzQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTg2MjY4ODE@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Bobby Cannavale","asCharacter":"Guyas Guy"},{"id":"nm0015382","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmQ2OGIzNWUtNGM1Yi00NTgxLThjYzQtMWExM2JkNTE2NWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTM5MTM5MDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje","asCharacter":"Nashas Nash"},{"id":"nm0953882","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA5NTkwMTg1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU2ODE3Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Zayas","asCharacter":"Louas Lou"},{"id":"nm2292661","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWM0ZmNiY2QtMmIwYy00NzU2LWE5ZjQtYzg2MTdhY2M3Y2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Zoe Margaret Colletti","asCharacter":"Tessieas Tessie"},{"id":"nm3632172","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgxOTU3MTMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI2NDg2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nicolette Pierini","asCharacter":"Miaas Mia"},{"id":"nm5351647","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjVlNmM5ZWQtYzk0YS00YWE5LWE4MzctZTE4MDIzNWJkNjkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Eden Duncan-Smith","asCharacter":"Isabellaas Isabella"},{"id":"nm4548936","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTUyNDRmYmQtYTMwNi00M2UwLWJjYzktMTU4NGE3OGQwMTlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Amanda Troya","asCharacter":"Pepperas Pepper"},{"id":"nm0592923","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzAwMDE3NjA3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTk5ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dorian Missick","asCharacter":"Annie's \"Dad\"as Annie's \"Dad\""},{"id":"nm1139632","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3OTk5Nzc2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEyODUzNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tracie Thoms","asCharacter":"Annie's \"Mom\"as Annie's \"Mom\""},{"id":"nm1898126","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2UzMWFkZjktMjQxNy00OTFhLTk4ZjctYTcyMzNmY2NmNzdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjA2NzQ4NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Birbiglia","asCharacter":"Social Services Inspectoras Social Services Inspector"},{"id":"nm1368866","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWU2NTc5ZWUtZGMwMS00YTFiLThkMmUtNGQwMDRkODJiMjNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA5OTUxODg@._V1_Ratio1.2429_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephanie Kurtzuba","asCharacter":"Mrs. Kovacevicas Mrs. Kovacevic"},{"id":"nm0888248","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2ExNzJlMzUtYWMwNy00YzQ4LWFiZmEtN2ViNzYzNzlmYjllXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzcwMTg1Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Van Wagner","asCharacter":"Harold Grayas Harold Gray"},{"id":"nm0406320","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWU5NTg4ZTItZmJjZS00NWFjLTg1MzUtNDEwODQ5MTM3OTFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ray Iannicelli","asCharacter":"Waiter at Domanias Waiter at Domani"},{"id":"nm0000150","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNzM0MjE4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDkxMzEwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael J.
