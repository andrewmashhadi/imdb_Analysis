Running into the Bigtop, he is an accidental sensation with his hilarious efforts to elude the police. The circus owner immediately hires him, but discovers that the Tramp cannot be funny on purpose, so he takes advantage of the situation by making the Tramp a janitor who just happens to always be in the Bigtop at showtime. Unaware of this exploitation, the Tramp falls for the owner's lovely acrobatic stepdaughter, who is abused by her father. His chances seem good, until a dashing rival comes in and Charlie feels he has to compete with him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 3 nominations","directors":"Charles Chaplin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"}],"writers":"Charles Chaplin","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"}],"stars":"Charles Chaplin, Merna Kennedy, Al Ernest Garcia","starList":[{"id":"nm0000122","name":"Charles Chaplin"},{"id":"nm0448224","name":"Merna Kennedy"},{"id":"nm0305087","name":"Al Ernest Garcia"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000122","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDcwMDc0ODAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY2OTI1MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Chaplin","asCharacter":"A Trampas A Tramp"},{"id":"nm0448224","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmNlMWViMDctNDA3MS00OTRjLWFjNGYtMjhmZGZhOTkwNDgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzk3NTUwOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Merna Kennedy","asCharacter":"The Proprietor's Step-Daughter Merna - A Circus Rideras The Proprietor's Step-Daughter Merna - A Circus Rider"},{"id":"nm0305087","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWY2MjQzNTItYjNkOS00Mzc2LTk4Y2EtNzcwYmJmYzhiMjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0714_AL_.jpg","name":"Al Ernest Garcia","asCharacter":"The Circus Proprietor and Ring Masteras The Circus Proprietor and Ring Master"},{"id":"nm0188357","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Harry Crocker","asCharacter":"Rex - A Tight Rope Walkeras Rex - A Tight Rope Walker"},{"id":"nm0204639","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzc1MThiYTgtOWYzMS00NGEzLWE5M2YtZGUyNGRhMWNiMWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"George Davis","asCharacter":"A Magicianas A Magician"},{"id":"nm0074788","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Henry Bergman","asCharacter":"An Old Clownas An Old Clown"},{"id":"nm0761866","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTc2ZWRlZWUtMDg3Yy00OGRmLTlhNzItNTQ1ZGY3OWRhYTk3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2MzI2Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Tiny Sandford","asCharacter":"The Head Property Manas The Head Property Man"},{"id":"nm0709466","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzZiYmI4MzUtOWMzMC00ZWM3LThmM2QtYjMyZTM2ZTYzZTgyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"John Rand","asCharacter":"An Assistant Property Manas An Assistant Property Man"},{"id":"nm0614730","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Steve Murphy","asCharacter":"A Pickpocketas A Pickpocket"},{"id":"nm0042317","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzVjMDQxM2ItZjJmNy00ZmZjLWI5MTQtNmQ1Yzk1ZWI1MjhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Austin","asCharacter":"Clownas Clown"},{"id":"nm0045471","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzdmYjgyZDItYmJkMi00NjM3LTk4MDQtNjVkODUxNzFhMTc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chester A.
