Later, the ladies welcome various celebrities, who join them in a chat or perform for the audience. The program also offers tips on beauty, fashion, diet, and relationships. Known for their freewheeling style, the hosts are often lampooned in late-night sketches.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 38 wins & 164 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin","starList":[{"id":"nm0000155","name":"Whoopi Goldberg"},{"id":"nm0066877","name":"Joy Behar"},{"id":"nm2641639","name":"Sunny Hostin"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000155","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4ODgzNjQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzczNzc0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Whoopi Goldberg","asCharacter":"Self -
