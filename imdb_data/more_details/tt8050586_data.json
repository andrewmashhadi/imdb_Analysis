New Yorker Leila is feeling lost in London. She had been one half of an uber-cool power couple with her business partner Sadie, but Leila has a secret - she has come to the realisation that she is bisexual and having split up with Sadie she has moved in with Gabe, a neurotic novelist who is having relationship problems of his own. Gabe doesn't know many lesbians and Leila has not got much experience of hanging out with heterosexuals and together the housemates enter into an awkward partnership. Gabe becomes Leila's unlikely \"wingman\" helping her to navigate her new life dating men and women - in return she introduces wide-eyed Gabe to the queer scene while also trying to help him decipher his unreadable, sort-of girlfriend Francisca. As Leila comes to rely on Gabe she finds herself struggling to come out to her gay friends, while her business relationship with Sadie hangs in the balance.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Desiree Akhavan, Maxine Peake, Brian
