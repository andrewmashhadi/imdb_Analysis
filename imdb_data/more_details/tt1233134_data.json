As it hates vibrations, he tries to get rid of it exposing it to church bells, but it pins him down and evokes memories of how it all started, the trauma of Uncle Ben's murder. However Ben's memory stays and encourages Peter to resist and wrestle loose. Now he brings the goo back to the lab and thinks he freezes it to death. Eddie is furious his rehabilitation is turned to hopeless. But the symbiont survived, transfers to Eddie and brings Peter's memories along.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Victor Cook, Dave Bullock","directorList":[{"id":"nm0177328","name":"Victor Cook"},{"id":"nm1989960","name":"Dave Bullock"}],"writers":"Victor Cook, Greg Weisman, Stan Lee","writerList":[{"id":"nm0177328","name":"Victor Cook"},{"id":"nm0918852","name":"Greg Weisman"},{"id":"nm0498278","name":"Stan Lee"}],"stars":"Josh Keaton, Edward Asner, Lacey Chabert","starList":[{"id":"nm0005079","name":"Josh Keaton"},{"id":"nm0000799","name":"Edward Asner"},{"id":"nm0000327","name":"Lacey Chabert"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0005079","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMTE0NzY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc3OTIxMjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Keaton","asCharacter":"Peter Parkeras Peter Parker"},{"id":"nm0000799","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0MDI4ODk5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzg3ODQ3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Edward Asner","asCharacter":"Ben Parkeras Ben Parker"},{"id":"nm0000327","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1Nzc3NzAwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1ODk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lacey Chabert","asCharacter":"Gwen Stacyas Gwen Stacy"},{"id":"nm0182456","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxNjE1NzUzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU0OTU0MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.9000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Costanzo","asCharacter":"Sullivan Edwardsas Sullivan Edwards"},{"id":"nm0191906","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyOTMyMjE2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ0NDE5NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Cummings","asCharacter":"Crusher Hoganas Crusher Hogan"},{"id":"nm0228356","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDJmNDJmMWItNjdlYi00YzcxLWEzMDEtYzkxM2U5ODM5YWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ben Diskin","asCharacter":"Eddie Brockas Eddie Brock"},{"id":"nm0002126","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI2MjQzNzcxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU1NDg5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dorian Harewood","asCharacter":"Doc Bromwellas Doc Bromwell"},{"id":"nm0495450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2IxNWVjNDQtN2Q5Yy00NWY1LTg0ZDktNDU4YjNjN2NiOWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joshua LeBar","asCharacter":"Flash Thompsonas Flash Thompson"},{"id":"nm0551223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5MzcxODc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzkzMzM2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vanessa Marshall","asCharacter":"Mary Jane Watsonas Mary Jane Watson"},{"id":"nm0724656","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI0OTg2NDQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAwNjkzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Michael Richardson","asCharacter":"Tombstoneas Tombstone"},{"id":"nm0815718","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGFmNGMzNzItMDVkNy00ZmU3LThhNjAtMWJmYjUwMmFlZjE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMzMTM4Mjg0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kath Soucie","asCharacter":"Martha Connorsas Martha Connors"},{"id":"nm0833338","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTNkZmY0MzQtMDRiNi00OWUyLTg3YjgtMDU2YTIwZjEwNjFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkwOTczMjI@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Deborah Strang","asCharacter":"May Parkeras May Parker"},{"id":"nm0005513","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE5YmJhZTAtN2RiYi00ZmFiLThiMmQtZjgxNzdlNjg0MzZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alanna Ubach","asCharacter":"Liz Allanas Liz Allan"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Action, Adventure","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"}],"companies":"Adelaide Productions, Culver Entertainment, Marvel Animation","companyList":[{"id":"co0061343","name":"Adelaide Productions"},{"id":"co0202412","name":"Culver Entertainment"},{"id":"co0249290","name":"Marvel Animation"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"9.4","imDbRatingVotes":"1458","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"hospital visit,hospital bill,symbiote,laid off,wrestling match","keywordList":["hospital visit","hospital bill","symbiote","laid off","wrestling match"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0976192","seriesTitle":"The Spectacular Spider-Man","seriesFullTitle":"The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV Series 2008â€“2009)","seriesYear":"2008","seriesYearEnd":"2009","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"12","previousEpisodeId":"tt1225148","nextEpisodeId":"tt1233135"},"errorMessage":null}
