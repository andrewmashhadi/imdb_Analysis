Pulling from her nearly 40 years of experience in the legal field, Gloria dives into the often complex and serious facets of the cases brought before her. Each episode brings with it new cases and a new set of plaintiffs and defendants who must provide sufficient evidence to prove or disprove the complaints that have been brought forward. While both sides lay out their versions of the details surrounding their case, Allred questions and tests the weight of the litigants stories against the letter and spirit of the law. Ultimately, it is Judge Gloria Allred, through her wit and wisdom, who must make the final ruling before the courtroom.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Gloria Allred, Brian Isom, Melody Baha","starList":[{"id":"nm0021608","name":"Gloria Allred"},{"id":"nm4803623","name":"Brian Isom"},{"id":"nm3216259","name":"Melody Baha"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0021608","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyNzYxNTU2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTc0NDM0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gloria Allred","asCharacter":"Judge Gloria Allredas Judge Gloria Allred…"},{"id":"nm4803623","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Brian Isom","asCharacter":"Bailiffas Bailiff"},{"id":"nm3216259","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Melody Baha","asCharacter":"Jenny Lawsonas Jenny Lawson"},{"id":"nm6721750","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjU3NDE2NzktYTQ2OS00MTQxLWIzZDMtYTk3ZmUyMDM3NDg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTQ3ODIyMTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brent Duffey","asCharacter":"Frederickas Frederick…"},{"id":"nm3970493","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Emily Pelz","asCharacter":"Britney Patricksas Britney Patricks"},{"id":"nm4640396","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cyndee Bentley","asCharacter":"Olivia LeDeauxas Olivia LeDeaux"},{"id":"nm3100005","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmQ4ZjEwODctYWJiYS00Nzg3LThhNWMtY2QwM2EwYjE5N2IyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzYxMjE0ODU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Keu Reyes","asCharacter":"Defendantas Defendant"},{"id":"nm5482007","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lisa Marie Gonzalez","asCharacter":"Alice Bronsonas Alice Bronson"},{"id":"nm4969916","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"A-yia Thoj","asCharacter":"Defendant Doug Leeas Defendant Doug Lee"},{"id":"nm1518544","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aerin Harris","asCharacter":"Tina Patricksas Tina Patricks"},{"id":"nm1981751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQ3MTA1MTAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTI2ODg0NzE@._V1_Ratio1.6571_AL_.jpg","name":"Sara Lynch","asCharacter":"Carla Thomasvilleas Carla Thomasville"},{"id":"nm3720125","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjQ3MjQ3YWUtYjE3Yy00YTU1LWIzZGEtNDAzOTQyZjhmNjg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjkyNzE4MTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Monty Geer","asCharacter":"Joseph Martinas Joseph Martin"},{"id":"nm1795825","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2NTgwNDUzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQzNjE2ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ron Hanks","asCharacter":"Barry Sharpeas Barry Sharpe"},{"id":"nm3419507","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mariela I'V","asCharacter":"Rachel Montesas Rachel Montes"},{"id":"nm4124644","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mario Sullivan","asCharacter":"Robert Gilesas Robert Giles"},{"id":"nm5713406","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Susan Pinckney","asCharacter":"Plaintiff Heather Beakmanas Plaintiff Heather Beakman"},{"id":"nm2284683","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGZjNDQzNGUtNjBhYS00ZGRkLTgyZDItMzI2YTg0MmVhMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY5OTI0NDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Khalilah Joi","asCharacter":"Daphneas Daphne…"},{"id":"nm0324000","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzUxNzgwMDM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc3MDAzOTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Matthew Godfrey","asCharacter":"William Helleras William Heller"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Crime, Reality-TV, Talk-Show","genreList":[{"key":"Crime","value":"Crime"},{"key":"Reality-TV","value":"Reality-TV"},{"key":"Talk-Show","value":"Talk-Show"}],"companies":"Entertainment Studios","companyList":[{"id":"co0127629","name":"Entertainment Studios"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-PG","imDbRating":"4.4","imDbRatingVotes":"106","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"court,civil rights activist,courtroom,judge,law","keywordList":["court","civil rights activist","courtroom","judge","law"],"similars":[{"id":"tt2361632","title":"Justice for All with Judge Cristina Perez","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2YwMTg0ZmItYTVmOS00ZjRhLTk1ZWQtMmVhNzRmZjkzZDE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODg3NDc1OTE@._V1_Ratio0.6763_AL_.jpg","imDbRating":"6.1"}],"tvSeriesInfo":{"yearEnd":"","creators":"","creatorList":[],"seasons":["2011","2012","2013"]},"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
