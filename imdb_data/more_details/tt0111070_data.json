On Christmas Eve, Scott reads The Night Before Christmas - then receives an unexpected visitor on his roof. When Santa is startled by Scott's calling out and falls, he disappears, leaving only an 8-reindeer sleigh and a suit with instructions to put it on if he's involved in an accident. Scott does, and is transported around the town dropping gifts through chimneys until he's taken to the North Pole and informed by a group, who claim they're elves, that he is now Santa. Charlie is proud of his dad's new job, though Scott's convinced it's a dream. Until his hair turns white, his beard refuses to stay shaved, he gains weight inexplicably, even for his sudden love of junk food - Now he's accepted it, there's just one problem: how to keep it secret from his disbelieving family.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 8 nominations","directors":"John Pasquin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0664756","name":"John
