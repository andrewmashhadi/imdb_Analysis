For all his eccentricity, Fluter sees clearly that Rome is the true source of all power, and he sets off on an extended royal visit, dispensing large sums of money to bribe both Caesar and the Senate to back him. The Egyptians, furious at this subservience, depose him in his absence and make his wife, Cleopatra Tryphaena, and his daughter, Berenike, joint monarchs. But the illegitimate Fluter has enough Ptolemy blood not to let go easily.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"John Frankau","directorList":[{"id":"nm0291125","name":"John Frankau"}],"writers":"Philip Mackie","writerList":[{"id":"nm0533524","name":"Philip Mackie"}],"stars":"Michelle Newell, Adam Bareham, Emily Richard","starList":[{"id":"nm0627820","name":"Michelle Newell"},{"id":"nm0054393","name":"Adam Bareham"},{"id":"nm0723791","name":"Emily Richard"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0627820","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michelle Newell","asCharacter":"Cleopatraas Cleopatra"},{"id":"nm0054393","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Adam Bareham","asCharacter":"Fluteras Fluter"},{"id":"nm0723791","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODk4ODFlNTUtMTQwMi00OTEzLWEyZmEtZDU4OWY5OTgzNDUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emily Richard","asCharacter":"Cleopatra Tryphaenaas Cleopatra Tryphaena"},{"id":"nm0781476","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Graham Seed","asCharacter":"Ptolemyas Ptolemy"},{"id":"nm0572870","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM5ZTg3Y2QtNDkyNi00MzRmLTg2NWQtYjgzODVlZmZjNjU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTIxMTMyNjc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shelagh McLeod","asCharacter":"Berenikeas Berenike"},{"id":"nm0362735","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMyNTA5MzQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODE0NjQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Hardy","asCharacter":"Julius Caesaras Julius Caesar"},{"id":"nm0140354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjY5MDliZTQtZGQ4Yi00MzQ5LWI0Y2QtMzllODUyNWRiY2UzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"Antony Carrick","asCharacter":"Canidiusas Canidius"},{"id":"nm0914810","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc5ZWNiODktYzgyZi00Y2NjLWE1YTQtNTQ0MzE1MDRiYjhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTUyMTMyMDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Moray Watson","asCharacter":"Gabiniusas Gabinius"},{"id":"nm0623762","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIzMTUwOTM5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg5MDY1MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Neame","asCharacter":"Mark Antonyas Mark Antony"},{"id":"nm0416528","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwOTI1MDU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI3NjM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Godfrey James","asCharacter":"Catoas Cato"},{"id":"nm0189561","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY3NDczMTA2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEzMTgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Graham Crowden","asCharacter":"Theodotusas Theodotus"},{"id":"nm0071838","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3ODkwODcyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk4MzYyMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"John Bennett","asCharacter":"Philoclesas Philocles"},{"id":"nm0675225","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzEzYTk2Y2UtNmUwZC00OGEzLTg0ZWQtNTc3MDZmNjc2MTU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Morris Perry","asCharacter":"General Chaereasas General Chaereas"},{"id":"nm0108926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Roger Brierley","asCharacter":"Demetriusas Demetrius"},{"id":"nm0036031","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjM3OThiZmYtMTI1ZC00ZjA2LTllMjktMjdmNTY4YTQ5NTY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2286_AL_.jpg","name":"John Arnatt","asCharacter":"Sophronas Sophron"},{"id":"nm0767644","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjcyMWZmYmQtYTNmZC00OGZjLWEyZGItOGZiYTJkOWEyOTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Savident","asCharacter":"Pythagorasas Pythagoras"},{"id":"nm0924476","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Arthur White","asCharacter":"Bolisas Bolis"},{"id":"nm0247482","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Easom","asCharacter":"Amyntasas Amyntas"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Biography, Drama, History","genreList":[{"key":"Biography","value":"Biography"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"History","value":"History"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0084998","seriesTitle":"The Cleopatras","seriesFullTitle":"The Cleopatras (TV Series 1983â€“1983)","seriesYear":"1983","seriesYearEnd":"1983","seasonNumber":"1","episodeNumber":"5","previousEpisodeId":"tt1253623","nextEpisodeId":"tt1253628"},"errorMessage":null}
