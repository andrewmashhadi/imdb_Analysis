They got married when he was still in prison, although their parents were against the marriage. Since her son Rocco (Rafael Santana) is born, Nuri is no longer working as a drug dealer, because he studied business administration in prison and now runs a translation and tax office in Hamburg. One day Rocco and Nuri are killed by a nail bomb that was deposited in front of the office. This has shredded everything. Because her husband was in prison for drug possession, the police investigated in the red-light district. The investigators do not see that the tracks point in a completely different direction. Then they happen to be the real killers on the net. The main suspects are neo-Nazi spouses André (Ulrich Brandhoff) and Edda Möller (Hanna Hilsdorf). But the trial is developing differently than Katja had hoped. Although her lawyer Danilo (Denis Moschitto) speaks of a watertight evidence, defender Haberbeck (Johannes Krisch) manages to settle the case in favor of the defendants. Humiliated and destroyed by the trial, Katja sees no reason to continue living. If she wants to restore meaning to her life, she has to take the law into her own hands.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 17 wins & 25 nominations","directors":"Fatih Akin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0015359","name":"Fatih Akin"}],"writers":"Fatih Akin, Hark Bohm","writerList":[{"id":"nm0015359","name":"Fatih Akin"},{"id":"nm0006737","name":"Hark Bohm"}],"stars":"Numan Acar, Adam Bousdoukos, Diane Kruger","starList":[{"id":"nm1485637","name":"Numan Acar"},{"id":"nm0100196","name":"Adam Bousdoukos"},{"id":"nm1208167","name":"Diane Kruger"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1485637","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDZjODhiMTAtYjUwMy00Yzc0LWE0MGEtZTY0OTNlZGMzZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM2MTczMjQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Numan Acar","asCharacter":"Nuri Sekercias Nuri Sekerci"},{"id":"nm0100196","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTFkM2JlZWMtYTllYS00NzAzLWJlOGYtYzA1NDI5NzcxMTExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5OTk2OA@@._V1_Ratio1.5429_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Bousdoukos","asCharacter":"Knackias Knacki"},{"id":"nm1208167","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MzY0Nzk2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ0MTMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Diane Kruger","asCharacter":"Katja Sekercias Katja Sekerci"},{"id":"nm0608324","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzMjUzNjc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA4ODYwNjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Denis Moschitto","asCharacter":"Danilo Favaas Danilo Fava"},{"id":"nm3119680","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczNzU3NTc5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA4ODYwNjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Samia Muriel Chancrin","asCharacter":"Birgitas Birgit"},{"id":"nm0499763","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Torsten Lemke","asCharacter":"Standesbeamteras Standesbeamter"},{"id":"nm8747755","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rafael Santana","asCharacter":"Rocco Sekercias Rocco Sekerci"},{"id":"nm0015355","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Cem Akin","asCharacter":"Kunde im Büroas Kunde im Büro"},{"id":"nm8342525","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0NTUyOTYzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTA4ODYwNjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hanna Hilsdorf","asCharacter":"Edda Mölleras Edda Möller"},{"id":"nm9952135","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Anke Opp","asCharacter":"Streifenpolizistin an Tatortas Streifenpolizistin an Tatort"},{"id":"nm9952136","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ina Neerfeld","asCharacter":"Kriseninterventionsmitarbeiterin Turnhalleas Kriseninterventionsmitarbeiterin Turnhalle"},{"id":"nm1258792","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmNiNmRhOGEtOGUyMy00NDU5LTg3NTgtZDA5ZDRhNDlhNzRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Laurens Walter","asCharacter":"Kommissar Fischeras Kommissar Fischer"},{"id":"nm9952137","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Angélique Mundt","asCharacter":"Kriseninterventionsmitarbeiterin Hausas Kriseninterventionsmitarbeiterin Haus"},{"id":"nm0626955","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Karin Neuhäuser","asCharacter":"Annemarieas Annemarie"},{"id":"nm0737492","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Uwe Rohde","asCharacter":"Michias Michi"},{"id":"nm9493255","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Asim Demirel","asCharacter":"Alias Ali"},{"id":"nm1572107","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aysel Iscan","asCharacter":"Hülyaas Hülya"},{"id":"nm0670700","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Henning Peker","asCharacter":"Hauptkommissar Gerrit Reetzas Hauptkommissar Gerrit Reetz"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Crime, Drama, Thriller","genreList":[{"key":"Crime","value":"Crime"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Thriller","value":"Thriller"}],"companies":"Warner Bros., Bombero International, Warner Bros.
