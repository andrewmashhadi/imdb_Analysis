We could use the imdb dataset included to:

	- Place in tables on aws db
	- clean the data
	- extract using r 
	- create general plots for genre, ratings, durations, movie vs tv show, etc.
	- Use a simple clustering algorithm (i.e. K-means) for determining similar shows/movies 
	  independently and combined 

Could make it more complex with additions:
	
	- scrape the imdb data ourselves
	- apply algorithm to check for similar descriptions of movies/shows
	- apply binary regression tree (boosting or random forest), or 
          NLP algorithm for predicting the rating of the movie/show
        - Use JSON file for data dictionary of data. Upload to data dictionary table. 
	- Use https://imdb-api.com/api#Top250Movies-header to webscape the data directly.
