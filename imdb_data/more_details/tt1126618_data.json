Desperate to get a job, she finally gets an interview with Jerry (Jeff Goldblum) - who is desperate to hire a producer for the struggling show \"Daybreak\". Becky accepts the job and it proves to be more difficult than even she might be able to handle. She has to fire the sexist co-host, then try to convince egotistical news reporter, Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), to take the job, and then try and get him to actually do the job, properly. And she has to do this while falling for handsome Adam (Patrick Wilson), and trying to save the show from plummeting ratings. Will Becky be able to hold on to her dream job and her sanity?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 3 nominations","directors":"Roger Michell","directorList":[{"id":"nm0585011","name":"Roger Michell"}],"writers":"Aline Brosh McKenna","writerList":[{"id":"nm0112459","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna"}],"stars":"Rachel McAdams, Harrison Ford, Diane Keaton","starList":[{"id":"nm1046097","name":"Rachel McAdams"},{"id":"nm0000148","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"id":"nm0000473","name":"Diane Keaton"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1046097","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5ODcxMDU4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAzNjQyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rachel McAdams","asCharacter":"Beckyas Becky"},{"id":"nm0000148","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4Mjg0NjIxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM2NTI3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Harrison Ford","asCharacter":"Mike Pomeroyas Mike Pomeroy"},{"id":"nm0000473","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5NDI5OTEyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzU4NDI1NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Diane Keaton","asCharacter":"Colleen Peckas Colleen Peck"},{"id":"nm0063800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjU5Y2MyOTMtZGZhMi00MjVjLWE1YTktZDNlNmNiOWJlNDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkyODYyMjk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Noah Bean","asCharacter":"First Dateas First Date"},{"id":"nm2274324","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Davidson","asCharacter":"Dog Walking Neighboras Dog Walking Neighbor"},{"id":"nm0039665","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjg3MmU4MzItOGEzYy00MTgxLTg1ZTEtNTEyMzZmNGMzOTk5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vanessa Aspillaga","asCharacter":"Annaas Anna"},{"id":"nm1865598","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjY3NjA1YjAtNjQyMS00YTRkLTkxYWQtNzQ1NGEzOWIxODRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDg0OTI4OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Hiller","asCharacter":"Sam - Channel 9 Produceras Sam - Channel 9 Producer"},{"id":"nm0694212","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMDUxMDIyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDkxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Linda Powell","asCharacter":"Louanneas Louanne"},{"id":"nm4154892","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mike Hydeck","asCharacter":"Ralphas Ralph"},{"id":"nm3824426","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joseph J.
