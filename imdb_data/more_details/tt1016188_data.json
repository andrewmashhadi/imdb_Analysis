One prisoner is surely a dangerous terrorist - but will the Americans find the right one? The outcome rests on the skills of one appallingly inept interpreter. In this powerful satire of war in the post 9/11 world, one simple slip of the tongue leads to increasingly absurd misunderstandings - and a tragic end for all concerned.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Michael Gaylin","directorList":[{"id":"nm0310920","name":"Michael Gaylin"}],"writers":"David Smilow","writerList":[{"id":"nm0807006","name":"David Smilow"}],"stars":"Davis Hall, Peter Handy, Chris Quinn","starList":[{"id":"nm0355477","name":"Davis Hall"},{"id":"nm2630634","name":"Peter Handy"},{"id":"nm2578699","name":"Chris Quinn"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0355477","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI0NTQxMDAxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgxMTMxNjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Davis Hall","asCharacter":"Colonel Pocklinas Colonel Pocklin"},{"id":"nm2630634","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Handy","asCharacter":"Captain Smeebleas Captain Smeeble"},{"id":"nm2578699","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Chris Quinn","asCharacter":"Private Burkeas Private Burke"},{"id":"nm2626963","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ozzie Fiaz","asCharacter":"Detainee #1as Detainee #1"},{"id":"nm1909150","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Manny Piatos","asCharacter":"Detainee #2as Detainee #2"},{"id":"nm1395723","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Muhammed Rum","asCharacter":"Detainee #3as Detainee #3"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"}],"companies":"Chalk Outline Films","companyList":[{"id":"co0207423","name":"Chalk Outline Films"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"Not Rated","imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$8,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"Your Tax Dollars at Work","keywords":"torture,iraq war,interrogation","keywordList":["torture","iraq war","interrogation"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
