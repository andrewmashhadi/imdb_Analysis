There, he rescues and cares for an abandoned grizzly bear cub who subsequently grows into a powerful adult companion named Ben. In addition, Adams learns that he has an uncanny link to much of the wildlife of the region who interact with him on their own without fear or aggression. Now \"Grizzly\" Adams lives in the wilderness with only an old trader named Mad Jack and an Native American named Nakoma as his only regular human friends. There he meets and aids a variety of visitors who usually are unused to the dangers this beautiful land can have. Unfortunately, while he protects the wildlife from unnecessary harm, he still must be watchful for the bounty hunters looking for the price on his head.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Dan Haggerty, Denver Pyle, Bozo the
