Ronald Reagan on July 14, 1970. The new law paved the way for creation of firefighter paramedic programs all over California. This series showcases the Los Angeles model and the emerging specialty of Emergency Hospital Medicine. In Los Angeles, firefighters train to certify as FF/PM, employed through the L.A. County Fire Department. The newly-built Station 51 has one full-size Engine and a smaller rescue squad truck which carries state of the art equipment used by the FF/PMs. This includes a mobile radio and portable EKG machine which allows them contact and transmit information to and from the field to ER specialists at hospitals like Rampart General. There are spectacular rescues and more mundane runs; prompt treatment in the field by FF/PMs keeps a large number of patients alive long enough to reach a hospital. At Rampart, teams of skilled professionals provide appropriate medical care to the patients transported by Squad 51 and other FF/PMs. A close friendship evolves between the Squad 51 FF/PMs and the Rampart emergency team. The FF/PM mantra: \"take it easy\" is born.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Randolph Mantooth, Kevin Tighe, Julie London","starList":[{"id":"nm0544168","name":"Randolph Mantooth"},{"id":"nm0001798","name":"Kevin Tighe"},{"id":"nm0518728","name":"Julie London"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0544168","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4NTczYWItMTQ3YS00OWJlLWIxMzYtNTY4OTA4YTM0MjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk3NTUyOTc@._V1_Ratio1.2714_AL_.jpg","name":"Randolph Mantooth","asCharacter":"Paramedic John Gageas Paramedic John Gage…"},{"id":"nm0001798","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NjQ3NDU5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE0NDg5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Tighe","asCharacter":"Paramedic Roy DeSotoas Paramedic Roy DeSoto…"},{"id":"nm0518728","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTkwNzA5NDEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjg0NjEwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Julie London","asCharacter":"Dixie McCall, R.N.as Dixie McCall, R.N."},{"id":"nm0873757","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzM2UwZTYtMzY2ZC00YWViLWFjZGYtZDcwNGMzM2E3OWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bobby Troup","asCharacter":"Dr. Joe Earlyas Dr. Joe Early"},{"id":"nm0298333","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MDgyOTYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA1NTgxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Fuller","asCharacter":"Dr. Kelly Brackettas Dr. Kelly Brackett"},{"id":"nm0530241","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Marco Lopez","asCharacter":"Fireman Marco Lopezas Fireman Marco Lopez"},{"id":"nm0831300","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzg3YzZkOTMtYjJiYy00ZWZkLWJhNjQtNWJjODc0MTAzODA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Stoker","asCharacter":"Fireman Mike Stokeras Fireman Mike Stoker"},{"id":"nm0232778","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDhhY2QzYTQtYjM0MC00ZDA0LWE4YWYtYzNiMzdmYzkxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tim Donnelly","asCharacter":"Fireman Chet Kellyas Fireman Chet Kelly"},{"id":"nm0635260","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc3MDc1ODktMDczNS00Y2E5LTliM2EtYmUzYWEyZjY1NzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Norell","asCharacter":"Captain Hank Stanleyas Captain Hank Stanley…"},{"id":"nm0683862","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ron Pinkard","asCharacter":"Dr. Mike Mortonas Dr. Mike Morton…"},{"id":"nm1806757","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Harold 'Hal' Frizzell","asCharacter":"Ambulance Attendantas Ambulance Attendant…"},{"id":"nm0486836","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sam Lanier","asCharacter":"Radio Dispatcheras Radio Dispatcher"},{"id":"nm0397660","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTExNzAzM2YtNThkOS00ZWI3LWEyOTAtN2FjMTg3Yjc3NjY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vince Howard","asCharacter":"Police Officer Vince, LASDas Police Officer Vince, LASD…"},{"id":"nm1998143","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Scott Gourlay","asCharacter":"Police Officeras Police Officer…"},{"id":"nm0117252","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjQzOTQwMTgtYTJjMy00NzZhLWJjNDYtNDdjNTJjNDFmYzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Bryant","asCharacter":"Captain -
