Roussel, a wealthy merchant, has the misfortune to have in Gasnier, a bandit, a double; the resemblance between them being remarkable. On the 27th of May, 1795, Roussel visits his father's little inn on the road to Orleans. At 7 P.M. he returned to Paris. At 11 P.M. the same night Gasnier and three companions, Nicolet, Champion and Minot, rob the Orleans coach, carrying $375,000 for General Bonaparte's army. Later Roussel is shot by Gasnier, who thinks the would-be assassin is his son. Roussel, the merchant, is arrested, tried and convicted. His future son-in-law tries desperately to prove Roussel innocent, but is thwarted at every turn by Gasnier and Roussel is finally executed. At the moment of his execution Judge Lebas discovers the real criminal and realizes an innocent man has gone to his death.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Albert Capellani","directorList":[{"id":"nm0135052","name":"Albert Capellani"}],"writers":"Louis-Mathurin Moreau, Paul Siraudin","writerList":[{"id":"nm1252541","name":"Louis-Mathurin Moreau"},{"id":"nm0320819","name":"Paul Siraudin"}],"stars":"Mévisto, Andrée Pascal, Paul Capellani","starList":[{"id":"nm0617787","name":"Mévisto"},{"id":"nm0664239","name":"Andrée Pascal"},{"id":"nm0135053","name":"Paul Capellani"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0617787","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzRhNDJiMmMtZWY0Zi00NGFhLWEzNzUtOGFhMDg1NmY4NDc2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mévisto","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0664239","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwMjE2ODQtODVkMy00OTU0LTkxOTgtOTk3MTlkMTE5ZjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andrée Pascal","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0135053","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmFmZDhiOGItY2M0YS00ZTI4LWE4MDgtYWE0ZDZlYWNkNzdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Capellani","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0712416","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Louis Ravet","asCharacter":"Rousselas Roussel…"},{"id":"nm0622472","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzMzQ3MjQxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDQzNzExMzE@._V1_Ratio1.3143_AL_.jpg","name":"Eugénie Nau","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0874575","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzNmMWY0Y2QtYmIxNS00MTAwLWFiZTctNmQ3MDIzMzRkN2FkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDUyOTUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Georges Tréville","asCharacter":"Nickoletas Nickolet"},{"id":"nm1280216","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maurice Luguet","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0226387","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc2NTYyNzAxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTczNzEwMzE@._V1_Ratio1.5429_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Dieudonné","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm2444808","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Grégoire","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm2379799","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Calvin","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm2380704","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Faivre","asCharacter":""}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Pathé Frères","companyList":[{"id":"co0012852","name":"Pathé Frères"}],"countries":"France","countryList":[{"key":"France","value":"France"}],"languages":"None, French","languageList":[{"key":"None","value":"None"},{"key":"French","value":"French"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"based on play","keywordList":["based on play"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
