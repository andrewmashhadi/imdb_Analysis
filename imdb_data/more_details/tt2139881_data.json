Charlotte Field (Charlize Theron) is one of the most influential women in the world. Smart, sophisticated, and accomplished, she's a powerhouse diplomat with a talent for...well, mostly everything. The two have nothing in common, except that she was his babysitter and childhood crush. When Fred unexpectedly reconnects with Charlotte, he charms her with his self-deprecating humor and his memories of her youthful idealism. As she prepares to make a run for the Presidency, Charlotte impulsively hires Fred as her speechwriter, much to the dismay of her trusted advisors. A fish-out-of-water on Charlotte's elite team, Fred is unprepared for her glamorous lifestyle in the limelight. However, sparks fly as their unmistakable chemistry leads to a round-the-world romance and a series of unexpected and dangerous incidents.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 13 nominations","directors":"Jonathan Levine","directorList":[{"id":"nm1349522","name":"Jonathan Levine"}],"writers":"Dan Sterling, Liz Hannah","writerList":[{"id":"nm1003839","name":"Dan Sterling"},{"id":"nm2176283","name":"Liz Hannah"}],"stars":"Charlize Theron, Seth Rogen, June Diane Raphael","starList":[{"id":"nm0000234","name":"Charlize Theron"},{"id":"nm0736622","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"id":"nm2053085","name":"June Diane Raphael"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000234","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk5Mzc4ODU0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU1NTI0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charlize Theron","asCharacter":"Charlotte Fieldas Charlotte Field"},{"id":"nm0736622","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NjgzNzcwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExMDYxOQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Seth Rogen","asCharacter":"Fred Flarskyas Fred Flarsky"},{"id":"nm2053085","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDEwZTMyZDktNTY4OS00ZmQ5LTkzZTEtYWFkM2JmOTM3MjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI0NTI3MzI@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"June Diane Raphael","asCharacter":"Maggie Millikinas Maggie Millikin"},{"id":"nm6578009","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzExMTU2NTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ0MzEzNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"O'Shea Jackson Jr.","asCharacter":"Lanceas Lance"},{"id":"nm2201027","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5NzM5MDA1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAwNjM5NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ravi Patel","asCharacter":"Tomas Tom"},{"id":"nm0644022","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWM5MDJjYTItMTRkNC00NTQ4LThkNjUtNDY3Mzk0YWMwMTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzQzNDYwMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Odenkirk","asCharacter":"President Chambersas President Chambers"},{"id":"nm0785227","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTgwYmM0ZjgtMWRmZC00YTc1LWIwYWEtYTFjMTZiMDNjNWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjcwMjczMzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andy Serkis","asCharacter":"Parker Wembleyas Parker Wembley"},{"id":"nm1320827","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2ViZjE4ZmItM2M5NC00NTI4LWI3YjEtZjk4ZWU5ODZkZThjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ5MjIzMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Randall Park","asCharacter":"Bossas Boss"},{"id":"nm1941571","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWQ2N2MxODMtZmU1OS00YzY4LWJjOWQtOGM5MmRmM2JlYWUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tristan D.
