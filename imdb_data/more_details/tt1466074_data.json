He had a bumbling demeanor, was overly polite and seemed to chomp on the same short cigar on a daily basis. However, beneath all that comical exterior was probably the most dogged investigator in the Los Angeles Police Department. Columbo was often called on to investigate high profile murders that involved the rich and famous. The culprits were often amused by him, and just as they thought they were going to get away with murder, Columbo would find a way to trap them or find enough evidence to make them confess.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 13 Primetime Emmys, 22 wins & 49 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Peter Falk, Mike Lally, John Finnegan","starList":[{"id":"nm0000393","name":"Peter Falk"},{"id":"nm0482474","name":"Mike Lally"},{"id":"nm0278201","name":"John Finnegan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000393","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4ODUwNDE3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA1NTM0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Falk","asCharacter":"Columboas Columbo"},{"id":"nm0482474","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mike Lally","asCharacter":"Bartenderas Bartender…"},{"id":"nm0278201","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4ODA0MjY4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQ3MjczMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Finnegan","asCharacter":"Barneyas Barney…"},{"id":"nm0116483","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1MjExMTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2ODUxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bruce Kirby","asCharacter":"Sergeant George Krameras Sergeant George Kramer…"},{"id":"nm0871384","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dianne Travis","asCharacter":"Executiveas Executive…"},{"id":"nm0199418","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM1Mzk3ODQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjE0MjU3NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shera Danese","asCharacter":"Cathleen Calvertas Cathleen Calvert…"},{"id":"nm0780005","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4MzMwOTU3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTE0MzkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vito Scotti","asCharacter":"Chadwickas Chadwick…"},{"id":"nm0566962","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ed McCready","asCharacter":"Detective #2as Detective #2…"},{"id":"nm0237134","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTljNGU2NDctZmJiYS00ZjA2LTliNTYtZjcyZjFhNmExYzNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"Fred Draper","asCharacter":"Cab Driveras Cab Driver…"},{"id":"nm0001526","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY3MTAzMTExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwNjUyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick McGoohan","asCharacter":"Col.
