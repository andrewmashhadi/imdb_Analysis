Guy Montag is a fireman who lives in a lonely, isolated society where books have been outlawed by a government fearing an independent-thinking public. It is the duty of firemen to burn any books on sight or said collections that have been reported by informants. People in this society, including Montag's wife, are drugged into compliance and get their information from wall-length television screens. After Montag falls in love with book-hoarding Clarisse, he begins to read confiscated books. It is through this relationship that he begins to question the government's motives behind book-burning. Montag is soon found out, and he must decide whether to return to his job or run away knowing full well the consequences that he could face if captured.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 4 nominations total","directors":"François Truffaut","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000076","name":"François Truffaut"}],"writers":"François Truffaut, Jean-Louis Richard, Ray Bradbury","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000076","name":"François Truffaut"},{"id":"nm0723827","name":"Jean-Louis Richard"},{"id":"nm0001969","name":"Ray Bradbury"}],"stars":"Oskar Werner, Julie Christie, Cyril Cusack","starList":[{"id":"nm0921459","name":"Oskar Werner"},{"id":"nm0001046","name":"Julie Christie"},{"id":"nm0159258","name":"Cyril Cusack"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0921459","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2MTExNzY3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTkwNDM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Oskar Werner","asCharacter":"Guy Montagas Guy Montag"},{"id":"nm0001046","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4MzIzMTE5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3NDA2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Julie Christie","asCharacter":"Clarisseas Clarisse…"},{"id":"nm0159258","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzMzEyNTU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc4MjQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cyril Cusack","asCharacter":"Captain Beattyas Captain Beatty"},{"id":"nm0226446","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjc3MGI4MjAtMDdjNy00NTgzLTk3NDctYzZmMGRiMjhkNjQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anton Diffring","asCharacter":"Fabianas Fabian…"},{"id":"nm0818215","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNWFjZWZiNDItMTRmZC00MzZiLTkzZDktNmYwYTVjNDViMTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2143_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeremy Spenser","asCharacter":"Man with the Appleas Man with the Apple"},{"id":"nm0240436","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bee Duffell","asCharacter":"Book Womanas Book Woman"},{"id":"nm0778808","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWJjNWEwZDEtNDZiYy00YTQxLTkyZmYtOTM0M2ExY2I2YmQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2143_AL_.jpg","name":"Alex Scott","asCharacter":"Book Person: 'The Life of Henry Brulard'as Book Person: 'The Life of Henry Brulard'"},{"id":"nm0017384","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gillian Aldam","asCharacter":"Judoka Womanas Judoka Woman"},{"id":"nm0050163","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGUwZjMyNWMtMjJiMi00MThjLWFmNWQtY2I1ZDRkMmMwMGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Balfour","asCharacter":"Book Person: Machiavelli's 'The Prince'as Book Person: Machiavelli's 'The Prince'"},{"id":"nm0060023","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWU2MTBkNTMtYTQyYS00ZjU1LWJjMGQtMjQwYjRjMTI5ZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alfie Bass","asCharacter":"Book Person: 'The Prince'as Book Person: 'The Prince'"},{"id":"nm0068029","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWFhOTkyOTUtOTEwZi00NjI3LTk3MTAtMGIyYmM0NmNmODQ5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTE2NzA0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3714_AL_.jpg","name":"Ann Bell","asCharacter":"Dorisas Doris"},{"id":"nm0086762","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzg3MWM1YzMtMzBhZS00MDllLWE2YzEtYWIzMjM4MjliMTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Yvonne Blake","asCharacter":"Book Person: 'The Jewish Question'as Book Person: 'The Jewish Question'"},{"id":"nm0184913","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjY4ZTY3MDMtOGNhZS00YzY3LTg1MmUtZjIyNzgwNGI1OGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"Arthur Cox","asCharacter":"Male Nurseas Male Nurse"},{"id":"nm0185021","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Frank Cox","asCharacter":"Book Person: 'Prejudice'as Book Person: 'Prejudice'"},{"id":"nm0185024","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Fred Cox","asCharacter":"Book Person: 'Pride'as Book Person: 'Pride'"},{"id":"nm0205233","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Noel Davis","asCharacter":"Cousin Midge -
