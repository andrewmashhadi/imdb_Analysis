When contact is lost with his son and the team, his sometime daughter-in-law is sent after them. She is a former C.I.A. operative and, accompanied by gee-whiz gadgetry and a few eccentric characters (including a mercenary, a researcher with a talking gorilla, and a nutty Indiana-Jones-type looking for King Solomon's Mines), sets out to rescue her former fiancé. What they all discover is that often what we most want turns out to be the source of our downfall.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 11 nominations","directors":"Frank Marshall","directorList":[{"id":"nm0550881","name":"Frank Marshall"}],"writers":"Michael Crichton, John Patrick Shanley","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000341","name":"Michael Crichton"},{"id":"nm0788234","name":"John Patrick Shanley"}],"stars":"Laura Linney, Tim Curry, Dylan Walsh","starList":[{"id":"nm0001473","name":"Laura Linney"},{"id":"nm0000347","name":"Tim Curry"},{"id":"nm0909620","name":"Dylan Walsh"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001473","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyMDc3Mzc2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5OTcyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Laura Linney","asCharacter":"Dr. Karen Rossas Dr. Karen Ross"},{"id":"nm0000347","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5MTQ2OTYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEzMTA1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Tim Curry","asCharacter":"Herkermer Homolkaas Herkermer Homolka"},{"id":"nm0909620","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1MDMwMDA2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc3NDA5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Dylan Walsh","asCharacter":"Dr. Peter Elliotas Dr. Peter Elliot"},{"id":"nm0001368","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjc1NDZjNTktOTRlOC00YmFmLWJkNTMtNzMzZWI1NGMyMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDc5OTcwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Ernie Hudson","asCharacter":"Captain Monroe Kellyas Captain Monroe Kelly"},{"id":"nm0381416","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNjQ3MjI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODE4NDQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Grant Heslov","asCharacter":"Richardas Richard"},{"id":"nm0000833","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2MDg4ODA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MzkzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.6286_AL_.webp","name":"Joe Don Baker","asCharacter":"R.B.
