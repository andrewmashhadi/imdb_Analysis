Kevin slights his younger brother Danny O'Shea by rejecting Danny's daughter Becky \"Icebox\" O'Shea, who is a good player. Kevin rejected her simply because she's a girl. Becky and some of her friends, boys who were also rejected, get the idea to start up their own team, to be coached by Danny. After Kevin tries to put a stop to that plan, Danny gets Kevin to agree to a game to decide which team will represent Urbania, because each town is allowed only one team. Danny and Becky scour the town in search of willing players, and they gather a crew of kids who have limited skills and no team spirit. They luck out when Becky discovers Junior Floyd expertly passing rolls of toilet paper right into a shopping cart at the supermarket, as though he's passing a football. With Becky and Junior on board, the new team, the Giants, has a chance to make a good showing, and they begin their training. But low morale continually threatens to break up the team. A chance visit by former NFL football coach John Madden and four NFL football stars -- Steve Entman, Bruce Smith, Emmitt Smith, and Tim Brown -- leaves the team with several tips on how to create an advantage. Becky develops a crush on Junior Floyd, and she's jealous when her cheerleader cousin Debbie flirts with Junior. Becky decides to compete for Junior on equal terms, so she puts on make-up and a cheerleader outfit, joining the cheerleaders and abandoning the team. But the Cowboys will be coming into the game with a vicious new player named Spike Hammersmith. Will Becky be there for the team if they need her?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Duwayne Dunham","directorList":[{"id":"nm0242271","name":"Duwayne Dunham"}],"writers":"James Ferguson, Robert Shallcross, Tommy Swerdlow","writerList":[{"id":"nm0272464","name":"James Ferguson"},{"id":"nm0787768","name":"Robert Shallcross"},{"id":"nm0842476","name":"Tommy Swerdlow"}],"stars":"Rick Moranis, Ed O'Neill, Shawna Waldron","starList":[{"id":"nm0001548","name":"Rick Moranis"},{"id":"nm0642145","name":"Ed O'Neill"},{"id":"nm0907323","name":"Shawna Waldron"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001548","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY5MTM4NTY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjA0NTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rick Moranis","asCharacter":"Danny O'Sheaas Danny O'Shea"},{"id":"nm0642145","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTI2NjcyODk0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMxODc4NzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ed O'Neill","asCharacter":"Kevin O'Sheaas Kevin O'Shea"},{"id":"nm0907323","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3OTAwNDA2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU0MjM4OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Shawna Waldron","asCharacter":"Becky O'Sheaas Becky O'Shea"},{"id":"nm0001701","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmQzN2E5MDctYTExYi00OTgzLTliNGYtYzdiYzgxZTIxZmZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Devon Sawa","asCharacter":"Junioras Junior"},{"id":"nm0098013","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2MzRkMTYtZGU1Yi00MmViLTkxYzUtNjJjZDJkMzEwYjIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MzgwMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Todd Bosley","asCharacter":"Jake Bermanas Jake Berman"},{"id":"nm0959055","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Zwiener","asCharacter":"Rudy Zolteckas Rudy Zolteck"},{"id":"nm0698090","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Danny Pritchett","asCharacter":"Tad Simpsonas Tad Simpson"},{"id":"nm0799923","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Troy Simmons","asCharacter":"Hanonas Hanon"},{"id":"nm0395353","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDhiNGJhYTMtY2JlYy00N2RiLWJjM2MtZDU1MTU5NzRhMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Horrigan","asCharacter":"Spikeas Spike"},{"id":"nm0799937","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joey Simmrin","asCharacter":"Murphyas Murphy"},{"id":"nm0865686","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1Mjk5MzcyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU0MzI1Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marcus Toji","asCharacter":"Marcusas Marcus"},{"id":"nm0906916","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Christopher Walberg","asCharacter":"Timmy Mooreas Timmy Moore"},{"id":"nm0567309","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Matthew McCurley","asCharacter":"Nubieas Nubie"},{"id":"nm0355083","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDdiNDA0YjgtOTc4My00YjVmLWE0NTktMzlkMTM5Njg0YmJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brian Haley","asCharacter":"Mike Hammersmithas Mike Hammersmith"},{"id":"nm0828124","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjQxMTkxOTQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQ3OTA1NDM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jon Paul Steuer","asCharacter":"Johnny Vennaroas Johnny Vennaro"},{"id":"nm0870729","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzI5ODIxMjAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0NDM5NTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Ellen Trainor","asCharacter":"Karen O'Sheaas Karen O'Shea"},{"id":"nm0860749","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1MTEzMjI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDMzNzY2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Susanna Thompson","asCharacter":"Pattyas Patty"},{"id":"nm0063218","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODhmYjNkZTYtYzQ4ZS00OWY0LThhOWMtNjZlODFjYmRjZjQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joe Bays","asCharacter":"Butzas Butz"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Family, Sport","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"},{"key":"Sport","value":"Sport"}],"companies":"Warner Bros., Amblin Entertainment, Warner Bros.
