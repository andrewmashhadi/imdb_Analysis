Trying it in the shop, he causes so terrific a draught that the old shopman is hurled backwards through the window. He then gives a public performance, and with one accord the occupants of the houses hurl chairs, tables, cushions, etc. at Tommy. Tommy's next feat is to blow a large party into the air, to fall through the roof of a house, and each succeeding floor. Naturally Tommy is the object of revenge, but after a humorous chase, he turns the trumpet on the pursuing crowd with marvelous results.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Tommy Footit","starList":[{"id":"nm2938053","name":"Tommy Footit"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2938053","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tommy Footit","asCharacter":"Tommyas Tommy"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Comedy","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"}],"companies":"Société Française des Films Éclair","companyList":[{"id":"co0071911","name":"Société Française des Films Éclair"}],"countries":"France","countryList":[{"key":"France","value":"France"}],"languages":"None","languageList":[{"key":"None","value":"None"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
