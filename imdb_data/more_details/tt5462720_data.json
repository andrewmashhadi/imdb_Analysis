His kids, Sara, Jack and Kendra, are grateful to him for making sure they're OK but decide it's time for him to get out of the house, so they turn to Vanessa (Leah Remini), his former police partner, for help. Vanessa has left the force to launch her own private security firm, and she makes Kevin an offer he can't refuse - to be her new business partner. Although the job isn't always glamorous and they rarely see eye to eye, Kevin and Vanessa share an undeniable bond from their years working together. Also, Kendra and her fiancé, Chale, face issues of their own, including becoming newlyweds and figuring out how they will support themselves. Once again, life has thrown Kevin some curveballs, so his dreams of an early retirement will just have to wait a little longer, and his family will always come first.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Kevin James, Taylor Spreitler, Ryan
