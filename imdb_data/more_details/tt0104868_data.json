After being charged for drunk driving, the court orders him to coach a peewee hockey team, the worst in the league, Gordon is at first very reluctant. However, he eventually gains the respect of the kids and teaches them how to win, gaining a sponsor on the way and giving the team the name of The Ducks. In the finals, they face Gordon's old team, coached by Gordon's old coach, giving Gordon a chance to face old ghosts.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 nominations","directors":"Stephen Herek","directorList":[{"id":"nm0378893","name":"Stephen Herek"}],"writers":"Steven Brill","writerList":[{"id":"nm0109359","name":"Steven Brill"}],"stars":"Emilio Estevez, Joss Ackland, Lane Smith","starList":[{"id":"nm0000389","name":"Emilio Estevez"},{"id":"nm0000722","name":"Joss Ackland"},{"id":"nm0809031","name":"Lane Smith"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000389","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzZGJlNDctYTE4Yy00MjI5LThlYzAtNjJhNDdlNmM2ZDM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ4NjgzNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emilio Estevez","asCharacter":"Gordon Bombayas Gordon Bombay"},{"id":"nm0000722","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWQyZmZkODQtZjE5Yi00MjVmLTk2OWItYzA3ZmExOWMxYjNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joss Ackland","asCharacter":"Hansas Hans"},{"id":"nm0809031","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM4NDc0NjQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTMyNzQ2MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Lane Smith","asCharacter":"Coach Reillyas Coach Reilly"},{"id":"nm0459706","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDYyNjg4MjU2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3NTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Heidi Kling","asCharacter":"Caseyas Casey"},{"id":"nm0813977","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI5OTc3NzMyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM1OTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josef Sommer","asCharacter":"Gerald Ducksworthas Gerald Ducksworth"},{"id":"nm0005045","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyMTkxMzAyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joshua Jackson","asCharacter":"Charlie Conwayas Charlie Conway"},{"id":"nm0711805","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAxNzczMjE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg3MzUzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Elden Henson","asCharacter":"Fulton Reedas Fulton Reed"},{"id":"nm0919169","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BM2YzYzUxMjktYTU5Mi00OGFhLWE4ODMtY2Y1MGRkNzc4ZWY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTUwNzA1MTgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shaun Weiss","asCharacter":"Goldbergas Goldberg"},{"id":"nm0301370","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTYyOTM1Njc1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQwMzgyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"M.C.
