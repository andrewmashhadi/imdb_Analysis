Mrs. Chasen is determined for Harold to be \"normal\", including her sending him into therapy to deal with his issues and finding him a girlfriend through a computer dating service. It is at a series of funerals that Harold meets Maude, on the cusp of her eightieth birthday, she who too attends funerals of strangers. Unlike Harold, Maude is obsessed with life - her own life to be more precise - she does whatever she wants to please herself, damned what others may think or how they may be affected. Since she can't take material possessions with her, she is more interested in experiences, with whatever material possessions she has - often \"borrowed\" without asking - only to further those experiences. Their friendship is initially based on how the other can further their own priority. But as Maude shows Harold how to truly live, Harold falls in love with her. Their relationship, already limited in time by the sheer math, is curtailed even more as Maude shows him only not how to live well, but die well.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 2 wins & 3 nominations total","directors":"Hal Ashby","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000797","name":"Hal Ashby"}],"writers":"Colin Higgins","writerList":[{"id":"nm0383359","name":"Colin Higgins"}],"stars":"Ruth Gordon, Bud Cort, Vivian Pickles","starList":[{"id":"nm0002106","name":"Ruth Gordon"},{"id":"nm0001069","name":"Bud Cort"},{"id":"nm0681954","name":"Vivian Pickles"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0002106","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4MjkxMjg0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODM0MTM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ruth Gordon","asCharacter":"Maude Chardinas Maude Chardin"},{"id":"nm0001069","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwMzM3MDc4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU4OTQ4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bud Cort","asCharacter":"Harold Chasenas Harold Chasen"},{"id":"nm0681954","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1NDU3NjU0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyMjM2MDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vivian Pickles","asCharacter":"Mrs. Chasenas Mrs. Chasen"},{"id":"nm0159258","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzMzEyNTU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTc4MjQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cyril Cusack","asCharacter":"Glaucusas Glaucus"},{"id":"nm0879006","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwMzUxNTgwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4OTc3OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Tyner","asCharacter":"Uncle Victoras Uncle Victor"},{"id":"nm0311619","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc3MTU4OTQ4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU2OTkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ellen Geer","asCharacter":"Sunshine Doréas Sunshine Doré"},{"id":"nm0160452","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczMTgyNzEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODIxNTc2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eric Christmas","asCharacter":"Priestas Priest"},{"id":"nm0939707","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODQ5MTg0ZTQtOGVmYy00NTJiLTk4MjQtMmM0NjdmZDg4NWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"G.
