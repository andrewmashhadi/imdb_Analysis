After consultation with her co-workers, she decides to bring him inside. Before long, she's being pestered by town busybodies, and even the military - and her house plants aren't behaving the way they used to. An absurdist romance; a science-fiction fairy tale about love's limits, and its transformations.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Romie Faienza","directorList":[{"id":"nm3326958","name":"Romie Faienza"}],"writers":"Romie Faienza, Jonathan Lethem","writerList":[{"id":"nm3326958","name":"Romie Faienza"},{"id":"nm0504672","name":"Jonathan Lethem"}],"stars":"Sarine Sofair, Lainey Shaw, Oliver Messenger","starList":[{"id":"nm3330066","name":"Sarine Sofair"},{"id":"nm2725287","name":"Lainey Shaw"},{"id":"nm3314976","name":"Oliver Messenger"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm3330066","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTBjZDY4M2YtOWU1ZC00NTA2LWI4ODItYWZjYjlhMWY5NDhmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk3NTUyOTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarine Sofair","asCharacter":"Judithas Judith"},{"id":"nm2725287","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lainey Shaw","asCharacter":"Evaas Eva"},{"id":"nm3314976","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDY1Njg5NWMtMmZlMi00YTc5LWE0YjktMTA4MWZmZjdhYWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDUxNjQ4ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Oliver Messenger","asCharacter":"Sleepy Manas Sleepy Man"},{"id":"nm3329581","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Allan Williams","asCharacter":"Regular Customeras Regular Customer"},{"id":"nm3082946","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Mallett","asCharacter":"Young Manas Young Man"},{"id":"nm3310487","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dot Smith","asCharacter":"Helenas Helen"},{"id":"nm3327937","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Reginald Ofodile","asCharacter":"Military Manas Military Man"},{"id":"nm3329852","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDFjMzk2NGMtZWM5MC00N2EwLThkOWItMWE5YzBmNDFjOWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pezh Maan","asCharacter":"Sergioas Sergio"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Fantasy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"London Film School","companyList":[{"id":"co0127761","name":"London Film School"}],"countries":"UK","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":"6.8","imDbRatingVotes":"5","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
