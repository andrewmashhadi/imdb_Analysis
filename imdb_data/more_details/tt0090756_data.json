Walking though a grassy meadow near the family home, Jeffrey finds a severed human ear. After an initial investigation, lead police Detective John Williams advises Jeffrey not to speak to anyone about the case as they investigate further. Detective Williams also tells Jeffrey that he cannot divulge any information about what the police know. Detective Williams' high school aged daughter, Sandy Williams, tells Jeffrey what she knows about the case from overhearing her father's private conversations on the matter: that it has to do with a nightclub singer named Dorothy Vallens, who lives in an older apartment building near the Beaumont home. His curiosity getting the better of him, Jeffrey, with Sandy's help, decides to find out more about the woman at the center of the case by breaking into Dorothy's apartment while he knows she's at work. What Jeffrey finds is a world unfamiliar to him, one that he doesn't truly understand but one that he is unable to deny the lure of despite the inherent dangers of being associated with a possible murder. Still, he is torn between this world and the prospect of a relationship with Sandy, the two who are falling for each other, despite Sandy already being in a relationship with Mike, the school's star football player.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 18 wins & 18 nominations total","directors":"David Lynch","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000186","name":"David Lynch"}],"writers":"David Lynch","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000186","name":"David Lynch"}],"stars":"Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper","starList":[{"id":"nm0000618","name":"Isabella Rossellini"},{"id":"nm0001492","name":"Kyle MacLachlan"},{"id":"nm0000454","name":"Dennis Hopper"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000618","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjg0MjczMzg2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MjA1NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Isabella Rossellini","asCharacter":"Dorothy Vallensas Dorothy Vallens"},{"id":"nm0001492","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMWIyNjgzZTktYmZiNS00YTE3LWJiNzItNmM1YjljZTViMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQyNDE4NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kyle MacLachlan","asCharacter":"Jeffrey Beaumontas Jeffrey Beaumont"},{"id":"nm0000454","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwNTQ5Nzg0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE2MDE4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dennis Hopper","asCharacter":"Frank Boothas Frank Booth"},{"id":"nm0000368","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI3NzY0MDQxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzMwMzcyNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Laura Dern","asCharacter":"Sandy Williamsas Sandy Williams"},{"id":"nm0486136","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA0NTU0NTc1MDBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDEyNjc0NjAx._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hope Lange","asCharacter":"Mrs. Williamsas Mrs. Williams"},{"id":"nm0001777","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjM3NTk3OTcwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUzNzgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dean Stockwell","asCharacter":"Benas Ben"},{"id":"nm0225419","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"George Dickerson","asCharacter":"Detective Williamsas Detective Williams"},{"id":"nm0688467","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwMzQ2NTczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODA2NjYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Priscilla Pointer","asCharacter":"Mrs. Beaumontas Mrs. Beaumont"},{"id":"nm0062844","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMwODUxNzQ2NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2MjA3Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frances Bay","asCharacter":"Aunt Barbaraas Aunt Barbara"},{"id":"nm0367558","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Harvey","asCharacter":"Mr. Beaumontas Mr. Beaumont"},{"id":"nm0832944","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ken Stovitz","asCharacter":"Mikeas Mike"},{"id":"nm0000374","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYxNTA2MDExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDE0MDAxMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brad Dourif","asCharacter":"Raymondas Raymond"},{"id":"nm0620756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODA5MDAyNDg2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2NDYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Nance","asCharacter":"Paulas Paul"},{"id":"nm0402853","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"J.
