We've all said \"I love you\" to someone who's dying, or already gone, when it was already too late. Our eyes are opened to what is truly important in our lives only when it's gone. Eddie McWaters promises to never let that happen again. He vows to live life to the fullest, to pursue all of his unaccomplished dreams, and try his best to convince others to not wait until it's too late to appreciate all that they have either.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Michael Mercy","directorList":[{"id":"nm2803226","name":"Michael Mercy"}],"writers":"Michael Mercy","writerList":[{"id":"nm2803226","name":"Michael Mercy"}],"stars":"Randy Butcher, Bryant Caplan, Lee Esser","starList":[{"id":"nm0124706","name":"Randy Butcher"},{"id":"nm2803230","name":"Bryant Caplan"},{"id":"nm2808135","name":"Lee Esser"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0124706","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjUwZWEyMDEtYjk4MS00NmY4LTgxMzItZWRiMjdkYmRhN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMDcxMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Randy Butcher","asCharacter":"Detective Koebelas Detective Koebel"},{"id":"nm2803230","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bryant Caplan","asCharacter":"Stuas Stu"},{"id":"nm2808135","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lee Esser","asCharacter":"Ticketmasteras Ticketmaster"},{"id":"nm2805472","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mark Folkes","asCharacter":"Eddie McWatersas Eddie McWaters"},{"id":"nm2809989","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rhonda Hewitson","asCharacter":"Bar patronas Bar patron"},{"id":"nm2807212","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Kilmartin","asCharacter":"Dr. Keirinas Dr. Keirin"},{"id":"nm2806559","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amanda Kind","asCharacter":"Gwenas Gwen"},{"id":"nm2803272","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Kovacs","asCharacter":"Joeyas Joey"},{"id":"nm2803164","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stephen McDougall","asCharacter":"Tobias Monroe IIIas Tobias Monroe III"},{"id":"nm2803282","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Luana Mercy","asCharacter":"Alice McWatersas Alice McWaters"},{"id":"nm2803226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Mercy","asCharacter":"Jack McWatersas Jack McWaters"},{"id":"nm2806045","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gabriel Moza","asCharacter":"Officer Ortegaas Officer Ortega"},{"id":"nm2806491","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Janet Moza","asCharacter":"Police dispatcheras Police dispatcher"},{"id":"nm2806323","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lance Nielsen","asCharacter":"Ted the landlordas Ted the landlord"},{"id":"nm2807410","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTBlNThmMjItODZmMi00ODM3LThhZGEtNzI1Yjg5YzQ5YThjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU5MjQ3MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Sansone","asCharacter":"Daleas Dale"},{"id":"nm2346882","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alan K.
