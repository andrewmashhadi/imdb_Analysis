Mr. Cooper runs a coffin factory, and times are tough. With only two staff, who conveniently also work as gravediggers at the Cemetery across the road, he comes up with a plan. But their unpleasant deeds soon attract the attention of the local priest after two teens go missing during a tress-pass into the Cemetery one night. And that's far from the worst of it.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"R.N. Millward","directorList":[{"id":"nm2122946","name":"R.N. Millward"}],"writers":"R.N.
