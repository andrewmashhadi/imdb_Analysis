Disgusting and ugly, most respectable people give themselves permission to destroy them at every sighting. How is it, then that small children are drawn to the cheerful yellow luminescence of these flowers, gathering the abundantly brilliant 'stars' to create golden crowns and necklaces. And if a bouquet is thrust forward in a chubby little hand, we don't recoil with disgust, but warmly accept the precious gift with a smile. Could there be some special promise in these resilient, omnipresent beacons? A promise of love that is passed from person to person, planting seeds in the heart that one day bloom only to plant seeds in the hearts of others.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Kristen Miller","directorList":[{"id":"nm3278404","name":"Kristen Miller"}],"writers":"John N.
