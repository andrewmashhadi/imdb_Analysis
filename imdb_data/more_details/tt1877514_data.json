Visceral and immersive, the series explores the human dimensions of the war through revelatory testimony of nearly 80 witnesses from all sides-Americans who fought in the war and others who opposed it, as well as combatants and civilians from North and South Vietnam. Ten years in the making, the series includes rarely seen and digitally re-mastered archival footage from sources around the globe, photographs taken by some of the most celebrated photojournalists of the 20th Century, historic television broadcasts, evocative home movies, and secret audio recordings from inside the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations. THE VIETNAM WAR features more than 100 iconic musical recordings from greatest artists of the era and haunting original music from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross as well as the Silk Road Ensemble featuring Yo-Yo Ma.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #21 | Nominated for 4 Primetime Emmys, 5 wins & 10 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Peter Coyote, Huy Duc, James Willbanks","starList":[{"id":"nm0001075","name":"Peter Coyote"},{"id":"nm9313512","name":"Huy Duc"},{"id":"nm9313542","name":"James Willbanks"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001075","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzOTIzMTQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4NTg3NjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Coyote","asCharacter":"Self - Narratoras Self - Narrator"},{"id":"nm9313512","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Huy Duc","asCharacter":"Self - North Vietnamas Self - North Vietnam…"},{"id":"nm9313542","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"James Willbanks","asCharacter":"Self - Army Advisoras Self - Army Advisor…"},{"id":"nm9313524","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Duong Van Mai Elliott","asCharacter":"Self - Saigonas Self - Saigon…"},{"id":"nm0473166","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjQ0ZWRjNTItMmJkNi00ZDBjLThhZjgtMzc0M2VkMWNiMDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTkyOTA4MjM@._V1_Ratio1.4714_AL_.jpg","name":"Joachim Król","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm0452926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hans-Gerd Kilbinger","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm3408091","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Simon Roden","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm0871149","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Josef Tratnik","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm0770967","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ernst August Schepmann","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm2366651","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Renate Fuhrmann","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecherinas Self - Sprecherin"},{"id":"nm1566008","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maximilian Hilbrand","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm0353875","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bernt Hahn","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecheras Self - Sprecher"},{"id":"nm13108672","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert Steudtner","asCharacter":"Self - Sprecherinas Self - Sprecherin"},{"id":"nm9313518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Musgrave","asCharacter":"Self - Marinesas Self - Marines…"},{"id":"nm9313521","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmZhNmExZmQtNTMwYi00N2Y1LWEyYTQtNWFhMDYzMmQ0N2ZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Phan Quang Tue","asCharacter":"Self - Saigonas Self - Saigon"},{"id":"nm4246809","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzhjZTZkNTUtNTRlOC00MjVlLWFlNDktNjg4ZWJmNjA0NDcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.5286_AL_.jpg","name":"Karl Marlantes","asCharacter":"Self - Marinesas Self - Marines"},{"id":"nm6039188","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Nguyen Ngoc","asCharacter":"Self - N.
