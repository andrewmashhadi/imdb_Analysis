Spirited and adored by the public at large she quickly found her marriage to be a disappointment, defined by her duty to produce a male heir and the Duke's philandering and callous indifference to her. She befriends Lady Bess but finds she is once again betrayed by her husband who wields his power with the three eventually living uncomfortably together. Against this background, and with the pressures of an unfaithful husband, strict social pressures and constant public scrutiny, Georgiana falls passionately in love with Charles Grey, a rising young Whig politician. However, despite his ongoing liaison with Lady Bess, the Duke refuses to allow her to continue the affair and threatens to take her children from her.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 8 wins & 21 nominations total","directors":"Saul Dibb","directorList":[{"id":"nm1314116","name":"Saul Dibb"}],"writers":"Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen, Saul Dibb","writerList":[{"id":"nm0368774","name":"Jeffrey Hatcher"},{"id":"nm0421314","name":"Anders Thomas Jensen"},{"id":"nm1314116","name":"Saul Dibb"}],"stars":"Keira Knightley, Ralph Fiennes, Dominic Cooper","starList":[{"id":"nm0461136","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"id":"nm0000146","name":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"id":"nm1002641","name":"Dominic Cooper"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0461136","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwNDM0NDA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkzMjQ3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Keira Knightley","asCharacter":"Georgianaas Georgiana"},{"id":"nm0000146","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzc5MjE1NDgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzg2ODgwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Ralph Fiennes","asCharacter":"The Dukeas The Duke"},{"id":"nm1002641","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU2OTk2NDc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTUyNzc4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Dominic Cooper","asCharacter":"Charles Greyas Charles Grey"},{"id":"nm0001648","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0MTgyMjIzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc3NTA0Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Charlotte Rampling","asCharacter":"Lady Spenceras Lady Spencer"},{"id":"nm2017943","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmRhZWVjZWMtMzUwZi00OTI3LThiMzAtY2VmMjU5YjQ0YjVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODMzMTM1MDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Hayley Atwell","asCharacter":"Bess Fosteras Bess Foster"},{"id":"nm0564402","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyOTEzOTg2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTU3MTQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Simon McBurney","asCharacter":"Charles Foxas Charles Fox"},{"id":"nm1264521","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzVmMjc0YmMtZGExOC00MDJlLWE3MzctOWI0YzBmYWJiMDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQwNTQ5OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Aidan McArdle","asCharacter":"Richard Sheridanas Richard Sheridan"},{"id":"nm0795344","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWQxY2E0NGMtMTY0YS00YTQ0LThjNjMtZDU0MDg5ODM4MTUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio2.3571_AL_.webp","name":"John Shrapnel","asCharacter":"General Greyas General Grey"},{"id":"nm0677944","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGY3MGMxZTMtNTM3ZS00NzcwLThmYmEtOTQwMzYyNGIxMjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY5MTQxNTk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Alistair Petrie","asCharacter":"Heatonas Heaton"},{"id":"nm0324009","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwNzU0MTUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc4OTkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Patrick Godfrey","asCharacter":"Dr. Nevilleas Dr. Neville"},{"id":"nm0575974","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmRjNjViNmUtOTkyNi00ZWE2LWFmZTQtMDQ2YWQ0YWQyMzhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxMjk0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.2429_AL_.webp","name":"Michael Medwin","asCharacter":"Speechmakeras Speechmaker"},{"id":"nm1517523","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTg2MmM3NDktMGQxNy00NzQ2LWJkNWEtYmQ3YmNkMjdiMTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDI5NjI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Justin Edwards","asCharacter":"Macaronias Macaroni"},{"id":"nm0564500","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGExMTBlYzktOTA1YS00MmI1LThlN2QtZmZhOGRjNDEyMzkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg3MDMxNzU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Richard McCabe","asCharacter":"Sir James Hareas Sir James Hare"},{"id":"nm2842144","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmU0MGRiNGYtZjg3NS00NzMxLTljZjItYTMwMWY2YTgwMDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Calvin A.
