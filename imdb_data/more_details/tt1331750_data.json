Two years and four months ago, when George proposed to Nora, she said \"maybe.\" She told Georges he wanted to make sure the girls, particularly Casey, could handle the move. But the real reason was because she was worried about whether Casey could get along with Derek. It was time they met, and the results of their meeting would determine whether or not Nora said yes. Bribed by his father, Derek promised to give Casey a tour of her potential new school. But instead, he convinced his friend Ralph (Shane Kippel) to impersonate him. By the end of the day, Casey thought 'Derek' was a great guy; but that his friend 'Ralph' was a jerk. Nora was surprised, but relieved. Maybe things would work out after all. But Nora's relief was short lived. Casey found out about Derek's prank, and was totally opposed to the idea of moving in with his family. Derek didn't like the idea any more than she did. So, in a twisted show of unity, they cooked up Operation Disengagement to keep their parents from marrying. The plan almost worked, but at what cost? Nora and George were inconsolable. And Casey realized that she and Derek were standing in the way of their parents' happiness. She decided to make things right, whether Derek agreed or not.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Moze Mossanen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0609119","name":"Moze Mossanen"}],"writers":"Daphne Ballon, Bernice Vanderlaan, Jeff Biederman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0051066","name":"Daphne Ballon"},{"id":"nm1580767","name":"Bernice Vanderlaan"},{"id":"nm0081301","name":"Jeff Biederman"}],"stars":"Michael Seater, Ashley Leggat, Jordan Todosey","starList":[{"id":"nm0780817","name":"Michael Seater"},{"id":"nm1430154","name":"Ashley Leggat"},{"id":"nm1671839","name":"Jordan Todosey"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0780817","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWI3MGVlMzQtYWE1Zi00NTg5LWFjNDItZWU5NzZmYzJlNThmL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3NDgwNzU@._V1_Ratio1.8000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Seater","asCharacter":"Derek Venturias Derek Venturi"},{"id":"nm1430154","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDdlYzQ5N2ItOTNhMy00NGM0LWIwOTQtMmQ2NjFkNTY5NWQ4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY1ODgwMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ashley Leggat","asCharacter":"Casey MacDonaldas Casey MacDonald"},{"id":"nm1671839","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjRlYWE2NmYtNzRhMC00YTM4LWE3N2MtODlmYzRiYjcyMGFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jordan Todosey","asCharacter":"Lizzie MacDonaldas Lizzie MacDonald"},{"id":"nm0535805","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODk3OTM3MTAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDA1NTQ4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Danny Mags","asCharacter":"Edwin Venturias Edwin Venturi"},{"id":"nm0849653","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTM0Mjc2MzY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDExODE0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joy Tanner","asCharacter":"Nora MacDonaldas Nora MacDonald"},{"id":"nm0707816","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTc3YzQ0NzEtMjcwZi00MTgwLTk2M2EtNmQyNWNhMjQ0MTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzc4Mjc1MTk@._V1_Ratio1.4286_AL_.jpg","name":"John Ralston","asCharacter":"George Venturias George Venturi"},{"id":"nm1659650","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2NDgyMDU5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzc2MTU0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ariel Waller","asCharacter":"Marti Venturias Marti Venturi"},{"id":"nm1011439","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5MDcwMTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDcxOTY0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Shane Kippel","asCharacter":"Ralphas Ralph"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Family","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Family","value":"Family"}],"companies":"The Harold Greenberg Fund","companyList":[{"id":"co0130269","name":"The Harold Greenberg Fund"}],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":"TV-G","imDbRating":"8.2","imDbRatingVotes":"7","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":{"seriesId":"tt0438719","seriesTitle":"Life with Derek","seriesFullTitle":"Life with Derek (TV Series 2005â€“2009)","seriesYear":"2005","seriesYearEnd":"2009","seasonNumber":"4","episodeNumber":"11","previousEpisodeId":"tt1327097","nextEpisodeId":"tt1340313"},"errorMessage":null}
