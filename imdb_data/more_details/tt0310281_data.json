To celebrate a life spent submerged in folk, Irving's loving son Jonathan has decided to put together a memorial concert featuring some of Steinbloom's best-loved musicians. There's Mitch and Mickey, who were the epitome of young love until their partnership was torn apart by heartbreak; classic troubadours The Folksmen, whose records were endlessly entertaining for anyone able to punch a hole in the center to play them; and The New Main Street Singers, the most meticulously color-coordinated neuftet ever to hit an amusement park. Now for one night only in New York City's Town Hall, these three groups will reunite and gather together to celebrate the music that almost made them famous.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 14 wins & 28 nominations total","directors":"Christopher Guest","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001302","name":"Christopher Guest"}],"writers":"Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy","writerList":[{"id":"nm0001302","name":"Christopher Guest"},{"id":"nm0506405","name":"Eugene Levy"}],"stars":"Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy, Michael McKean","starList":[{"id":"nm0001302","name":"Christopher Guest"},{"id":"nm0506405","name":"Eugene Levy"},{"id":"nm0571106","name":"Michael McKean"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001302","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0NzU2MjMzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzQwMDMz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Guest","asCharacter":"Alan Barrowsas Alan Barrows"},{"id":"nm0506405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NTQ5NjA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgwMjQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eugene Levy","asCharacter":"Mitch Cohenas Mitch Cohen"},{"id":"nm0571106","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwMzEwMDI4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDY3NDA0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael McKean","asCharacter":"Jerry Palteras Jerry Palter"},{"id":"nm0733427","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxNDg4MzA5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM3MDc1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Harry Shearer","asCharacter":"Mark Shubbas Mark Shubb"},{"id":"nm0604272","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDQ2ZTgyYTgtYmNmYy00NTdkLTg4NzUtMThjZDhjODBkMTQzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Moret","asCharacter":"Newscasteras Newscaster"},{"id":"nm1348110","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stuart Luce","asCharacter":"Irving Steinbloomas Irving Steinbloom"},{"id":"nm0343444","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0Njg1NDk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzA0MjYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Gross","asCharacter":"Ma Klapperas Ma Klapper"},{"id":"nm0067506","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwOTM1Mjg1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODYwMDEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marty Belafsky","asCharacter":"Ramblin' Sandy Pitnikas Ramblin' Sandy Pitnik"},{"id":"nm0059724","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael S.
