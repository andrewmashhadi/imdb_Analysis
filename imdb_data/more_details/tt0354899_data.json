The job ends up not being quite as she had made it out to be - it more a dead end menial job - but Stéphane is still able to eke out a friendship of sorts with his new coworkers, especially Guy, the senior employee, a bully of a man-child who obsesses about sex and who becomes Stéphane's confidante. Concurrently, Stéphane strikes a friendship with his neighbor, Stéphanie, and her friend, Zoé, Stéphane and their friendship stemming out of some mistruths, including the two artistically inclined women not divulging they, like him, lead dead end nine-to-five jobs, and Stéphane also not divulging that he is actually Stéphanie's neighbor and the son of her landlady which allows him to spy on Stéphanie's apartment without notice. While Stéphane is romantically interested in Zoé, he believes Stéphanie in turn is interested in him. Regardless, Stéphane forms a special bond with Stéphanie, their similar names only one of the many factors which may indicate that the cosmos meant for them to have this bond. Despite what Stéphanie may feel for Stéphane in return, their friendship/relationship will be affected by Stéphane often not being able to differentiate between reality and what are, to him, his very vivid dreams.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 7 wins & 9 nominations","directors":"Michel Gondry","directorList":[{"id":"nm0327273","name":"Michel Gondry"}],"writers":"Michel Gondry","writerList":[{"id":"nm0327273","name":"Michel Gondry"}],"stars":"Gael García Bernal, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Miou-Miou","starList":[{"id":"nm0305558","name":"Gael García Bernal"},{"id":"nm0001250","name":"Charlotte Gainsbourg"},{"id":"nm0591877","name":"Miou-Miou"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0305558","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzNjg4NzMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjExNjQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gael García Bernal","asCharacter":"Stéphane Mirouxas Stéphane Miroux"},{"id":"nm0001250","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQyMzQ5NTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjI3NTEzNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charlotte Gainsbourg","asCharacter":"Stéphanieas Stéphanie"},{"id":"nm0591877","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ4MTQwNjQ3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk4ODgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Miou-Miou","asCharacter":"Christine Mirouxas Christine Miroux"},{"id":"nm0149260","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwODMzMTc3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjk2NDM0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alain Chabat","asCharacter":"Guyas Guy"},{"id":"nm0889005","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDViZjdlYjAtZWRlNS00NWMwLWI2NWMtYzQzYTM3ZGFlN2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Pierre Vaneck","asCharacter":"Monsieur Pouchetas Monsieur Pouchet"},{"id":"nm0004381","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1OTk5MTQ1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ3OTc1Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emma de Caunes","asCharacter":"Zoéas Zoé"},{"id":"nm0677546","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aurélia Petit","asCharacter":"Martineas Martine"},{"id":"nm0099820","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE5MzM4NzQwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDE3NDM0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sacha Bourdo","asCharacter":"Sergeas Serge"},{"id":"nm0582755","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stéphane Metzger","asCharacter":"Sylvainas Sylvain"},{"id":"nm0210492","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alain de Moyencourt","asCharacter":"Gérardas Gérard"},{"id":"nm0508182","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Inigo Lezzi","asCharacter":"Monsieur Persinnetas Monsieur Persinnet"},{"id":"nm0677616","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Yvette Petit","asCharacter":"Ivanaas Ivana"},{"id":"nm0076259","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYyNjk0NjkwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDU1OTcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jean-Michel Bernard","asCharacter":"Piano-playing Policemanas Piano-playing Policeman"},{"id":"nm0548033","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Eric Mariotto","asCharacter":"Policemanas Policeman"},{"id":"nm1472479","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bertrand Delpierre","asCharacter":"Présentateur JTas Présentateur JT"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama, Fantasy","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Fantasy","value":"Fantasy"}],"companies":"Partizan Films, Gaumont, France 3 Cinéma","companyList":[{"id":"co0309685","name":"Partizan Films"},{"id":"co0172053","name":"Gaumont"},{"id":"co0044140","name":"France 3 Cinéma"}],"countries":"France, Italy, USA","countryList":[{"key":"France","value":"France"},{"key":"Italy","value":"Italy"},{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"French, English, Spanish","languageList":[{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"Spanish","value":"Spanish"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"7.2","imDbRatingVotes":"69170","metacriticRating":"70","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$6,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$347,925","grossUSA":"$4,670,644","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$15,116,179"},"tagline":"Close your eyes.
