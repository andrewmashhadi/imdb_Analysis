His roommate, Neil Perry, although exceedingly bright and popular, is very much under the thumb of his overbearing father. The two, along with their other friends, meet Professor Keating, their new English teacher, who tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to go against the status quo. Each does so in his own way, and is changed for life.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #210 | Won 1 Oscar, 20 wins & 19 nominations total","directors":"Peter Weir","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001837","name":"Peter Weir"}],"writers":"Tom Schulman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0776114","name":"Tom Schulman"}],"stars":"Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke","starList":[{"id":"nm0000245","name":"Robin Williams"},{"id":"nm0000494","name":"Robert Sean Leonard"},{"id":"nm0000160","name":"Ethan Hawke"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000245","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTYzMjc2Mjg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc1OTQwNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robin Williams","asCharacter":"John Keatingas John Keating"},{"id":"nm0000494","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzMTU0OTk3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjk4NzE3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Sean Leonard","asCharacter":"Neil Perryas Neil Perry"},{"id":"nm0000160","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4NDMxMTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE3ODE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ethan Hawke","asCharacter":"Todd Andersonas Todd Anderson"},{"id":"nm0001038","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM2MTY1Mzg5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODk1MjkzMTI@._V1_Ratio1.0714_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Charles","asCharacter":"Knox Overstreetas Knox Overstreet"},{"id":"nm0360796","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gale Hansen","asCharacter":"Charlie Daltonas Charlie Dalton"},{"id":"nm0476378","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzMzc2NTU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDkyNzU2MDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dylan Kussman","asCharacter":"Richard Cameronas Richard Cameron"},{"id":"nm0749456","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjllNDU1ODQtNjdhZS00YTU1LTkyNDMtMjNmNTg4NmFlZmYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Allelon Ruggiero","asCharacter":"Steven Meeksas Steven Meeks"},{"id":"nm0914209","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmRjNWY3NmYtNDgzYS00ZTA1LWE2YjMtMGJlZWEzMzg0NDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Waterston","asCharacter":"Gerard Pittsas Gerard Pitts"},{"id":"nm0516093","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyOTY5MTkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDYxMDU0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Norman Lloyd","asCharacter":"Mr. Nolanas Mr. Nolan"},{"id":"nm0001748","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NTQxNTkxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjAzMjU5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kurtwood Smith","asCharacter":"Mr. Perryas Mr. Perry"},{"id":"nm0069724","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Carla Belver","asCharacter":"Mrs. Perryas Mrs. Perry"},{"id":"nm0694676","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Leon Pownall","asCharacter":"McAllisteras McAllister"},{"id":"nm0552327","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGQzNGY1MDUtMTdhOS00NDQ3LWE2NjEtNWUwYjU1NjcwY2E4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio2.1286_AL_.jpg","name":"George Martin","asCharacter":"Dr. Hageras Dr. Hager"},{"id":"nm0041767","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joe Aufiery","asCharacter":"Chemistry Teacheras Chemistry Teacher"},{"id":"nm0136999","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Matt Carey","asCharacter":"Hopkinsas Hopkins"},{"id":"nm0004668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1NjM1MTc4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzYzNTcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Cooney","asCharacter":"Joe Danburryas Joe Danburry"},{"id":"nm0601328","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jane Moore","asCharacter":"Mrs. Danburryas Mrs. Danburry"},{"id":"nm0001223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0MzY3OTY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkxOTI0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lara Flynn Boyle","asCharacter":"Ginny Danburryas Ginny Danburry"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Touchstone Pictures, Silver Screen Partners IV, A Steven Haft Production","companyList":[{"id":"co0049348","name":"Touchstone Pictures"},{"id":"co0133018","name":"Silver Screen Partners IV"},{"id":"co0587257","name":"A Steven Haft Production"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English, Latin","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"Latin","value":"Latin"}],"contentRating":"PG","imDbRating":"8.1","imDbRatingVotes":"470613","metacriticRating":"79","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$16,400,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$340,456","grossUSA":"$95,860,116","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$235,860,116"},"tagline":"He was their inspiration.
