When Dawn is ultimately successful, she finds herself facing May for the finals, after May defeats Zoey in a real point squeaker, determined by the clock. Vowing to have 'no hard feelings no matter who wins', Dawn once again teams up with Piplup, while May calls upon her powerful Glaceon to battle. The fierce attacks fly back and forth, while Ash, Brock and Zoey marvel at the abilities of both Coordinators to use moves that are powerful, yet truly show off their Pokémon - while at the same time May and Dawn marvel at each other's work admiringly. With points almost equal, the battling chases down the clock, until time is up. But who should end up winning the prestigious Aqua Ribbon in a super - close finish, but DAWN! Happy to have seen everyone once again, May leaves the Sinnoh region, vowing to be the winner the next time she and Dawn have a battle. And our Heroes continue on their quests: Ash to join the Sinnoh League, and a revitalized Dawn to become TOP Contest Coordinator!","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Norihiko Sutô, Lotte Horlings","directorList":[{"id":"nm0837219","name":"Norihiko Sutô"},{"id":"nm6858340","name":"Lotte
