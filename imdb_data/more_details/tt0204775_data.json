The only thing that saves his life in this lame-brain scheme is that he promptly rams into a space station and is able to settle into the complex. Stuck there, Commander Rick decides to devote his time to exploring the only mediums that seem to deal with the real issues of the day, Science Fiction/Fantasy literature and comic books. In this show, Rick interviews a wide variety of writers and comic book talents about their work and how it relates to particular artistic, political and philosophic themes.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Rick Green, P.D.
