That will cover their bet with René, but a day late, so he makes them 'work for it' as sample clerks for the Caribean energy drink he's marketing in New York for white Jamaican John Lardner, a fellow ex-con and hence a recipe for disaster according to Rene's parole officer Larry. They play hookey to collect and deliver the t-shirts, but the truck ends up being stolen. Meanwhile Darren gets his board to engage lover Rachel, whom he invited to move in, to redecorate his hotel with her enthusiastic boss, but instead she feel 'manipulated,' gets drunk and most rudely tries to win Ben back, just when he was ready to give Julie a go.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Danny Leiner","directorList":[{"id":"nm0500444","name":"Danny
