They are to go there on a ship christened the Jupiter 2. However, Doctor Zachary Smith, an agent for an enemy government, is sent to sabotage the mission. He is successful in reprogramming the ship's robot, but in the process becomes trapped on the ship, and because of his excess weight, the ship and all on board become hopelessly lost and it now becomes a fight for survival as the crew tries to find their way back home.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys, 1 win & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Guy Williams, June Lockhart, Mark Goddard","starList":[{"id":"nm0930713","name":"Guy Williams"},{"id":"nm0001478","name":"June Lockhart"},{"id":"nm0323813","name":"Mark Goddard"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0930713","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA0NTY5MTg5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxNjM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Guy Williams","asCharacter":"Dr. John Robinsonas Dr. John Robinson"},{"id":"nm0001478","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0Nzk3NzMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI3MjY5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"June Lockhart","asCharacter":"Maureen Robinsonas Maureen Robinson…"},{"id":"nm0323813","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk0MTQ3NjA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4OTkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark Goddard","asCharacter":"Major Don Westas Major Don West…"},{"id":"nm0471549","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxNTY2NTc4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAwODQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marta Kristen","asCharacter":"Judy Robinsonas Judy Robinson…"},{"id":"nm0612621","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI3NDY1NTIyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTU5NzQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Mumy","asCharacter":"Will Robinsonas Will Robinson"},{"id":"nm0142145","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM4NjgxNjAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzI3NTEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Angela Cartwright","asCharacter":"Penny Robinsonas Penny Robinson…"},{"id":"nm0364893","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzMzY2MzY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjA2ODI0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan Harris","asCharacter":"Dr. Zachary Smithas Dr. Zachary Smith…"},{"id":"nm1631308","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dawson Palmer","asCharacter":"Monsteras Monster…"},{"id":"nm0590048","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jim Mills","asCharacter":"Saticon #1as Saticon #1…"},{"id":"nm0600355","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjA3OGFiOTItZjdiMS00OTEzLWJjNDQtMWZlMjM3Y2UyMTdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2MzI2Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Harry Monty","asCharacter":"Geooas Geoo…"},{"id":"nm0366690","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzc1NzA3YWQtNzZiOC00MzU1LTkwY2QtMjQ0NGUxNjVmYzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.6000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dee Hartford","asCharacter":"Verdaas Verda…"},{"id":"nm0270915","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODdjZTY2MDYtZmY2Yy00YjU5LWJkZWMtOGQxOWI4YjA1ZDhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTk5NzQ5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fritz Feld","asCharacter":"Mr. Zumdishas Mr. Zumdish"},{"id":"nm0021052","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAzNzQ4Mzc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAxMzc1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sheila Allen","asCharacter":"Aunt Gammaas Aunt Gamma…"},{"id":"nm0304532","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ron Gans","asCharacter":"Alien Leaderas Alien Leader…"},{"id":"nm1663575","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ronald Weber","asCharacter":"Alien Dictatoras Alien Dictator…"},{"id":"nm0758692","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MjAxNDE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTUxMjkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Salmi","asCharacter":"Alonzo P.
