Frank's partners include Peter Watts, a friend from the Group who serves as his handler, Frank's old friend Lt. Bob 'Bletch' Bletcher from the Seattle Police Department and sympathetic SPD detective Bob Giebelhouse, who also occasionally asks for Frank's help. In season 2, Frank partners up and befriends with the group's latest recruit, Lara Means, a young woman troubled by a gift similar to Frank's. In season 3, Frank partners up with the young dedicated FBI agent Emma Hollis who wants to prove herself to him, which sometimes backfires on her. Most of the cases Frank works on involve killers, lunatics, conspirators and amoral people with criminal intent. However, Frank, who does not believe in the supernatural, must also deal on occasion with those who may or may not be of an actual demonic or angelic nature and not simply evil. Frank's loyalties end up being tested time and time again by both the other-worldly and the Group, which itself seems to be obsessed with the upcoming end of the millennium.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Primetime Emmys, 6 wins & 31 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Lance Henriksen, Megan Gallagher, Terry O'Quinn","starList":[{"id":"nm0000448","name":"Lance Henriksen"},{"id":"nm0302446","name":"Megan Gallagher"},{"id":"nm0642368","name":"Terry O'Quinn"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000448","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2ZlZTc5ZWUtZmZiMi00YWNlLTlmNTMtZWI0MGFmMjBmOWVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIzODQxNzk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lance Henriksen","asCharacter":"Frank Blackas Frank Black"},{"id":"nm0302446","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGNiZTIwNGEtMjVhMi00NjY1LWExMTgtNTc2YjMwYzgwYWRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzYxNDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Megan Gallagher","asCharacter":"Catherine Blackas Catherine Black"},{"id":"nm0642368","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2NDY4Nzg5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjcwODA2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Terry O'Quinn","asCharacter":"Peter Wattsas Peter Watts"},{"id":"nm0864117","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTczOTU2ODQwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQwOTEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brittany Tiplady","asCharacter":"Jordan Blackas Jordan Black"},{"id":"nm0779455","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc4NTA4MDQ1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIxNTA0MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Klea Scott","asCharacter":"Agent Emma Hollisas Agent Emma Hollis"},{"id":"nm0485917","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stephen J.
