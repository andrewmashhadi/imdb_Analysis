He grew up in the area, having been raised by his now-widowed Aunt Joan Norton (Stephanie Cole). His reasons for leaving London and the high-paid life of a surgeon are not clear initially but related to a phobia he has. He soon meets several of the locals and eccentricity abounds. Martin's situation is made more difficult by what can only be referred as an almost complete lack of an acceptable bedside manner. He is gruff, abrupt, and intolerant, not only in issues related to medicine, but to life in general. He and the headmistress of the local school, Louisa Glasson (Caroline Catz), are clearly attracted to each other and, despite their awkwardness, slowly develop a relationship.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 2 wins & 11 nominations","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz, Ian
