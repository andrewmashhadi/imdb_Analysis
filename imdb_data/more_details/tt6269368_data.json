Tyler Burnside is a Boy Scout, a volunteer at his local church, and the dutiful son of an upstanding, community leader dad. Only one thing troubles the quiet Kentucky town he lives in: the unsolved murders in which ten women were brutally tortured and killed by a psychopath known as Clovehitch, which rocked the community more than a decade ago. When Tyler discovers a cache of disturbing images in his father's possession, he begins to suspect that the man he trusts most in the world may be Clovehitch, and that his deadly rampage may not be over. With unrelenting tension, director Duncan Skiles crafts a picture-perfect vision of the all-American family and then piece by piece rips it to shreds.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win","directors":"Duncan Skiles","directorList":[{"id":"nm1892658","name":"Duncan Skiles"}],"writers":"Christopher Ford","writerList":[{"id":"nm1755986","name":"Christopher Ford"}],"stars":"Dylan McDermott, Charlie Plummer, Samantha Mathis","starList":[{"id":"nm0001518","name":"Dylan McDermott"},{"id":"nm4055138","name":"Charlie Plummer"},{"id":"nm0000526","name":"Samantha Mathis"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMjY2NzU4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg2NDc4Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dylan McDermott","asCharacter":"Don Burnsideas Don Burnside"},{"id":"nm4055138","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2Q2YjUzOWUtMzYwMy00YTE4LWE0ZmMtZTJkY2YyMDUzMjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM1Nzk1NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charlie Plummer","asCharacter":"Tyler Burnsideas Tyler Burnside"},{"id":"nm0000526","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg5MDgyMTU3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE1MzY1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Samantha Mathis","asCharacter":"Cindy Burnsideas Cindy Burnside"},{"id":"nm2295293","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMzNDkxMTY1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzIxNzU0OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Madisen Beaty","asCharacter":"Kassias Kassi"},{"id":"nm5544807","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDQ5NGE0MGEtYThjNy00MzQ0LWFiNWEtM2I3OTUyYWEyNThiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDE2NjU0NDA@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brenna Sherman","asCharacter":"Susie Burnsideas Susie Burnside"},{"id":"nm2459196","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmYyYjgzYWQtNzg2OS00NGQ0LTg5Y2YtYjdhZDFlOTJlZTZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUwNzAwOTY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lance Chantiles-Wertz","asCharacter":"Billyas Billy"},{"id":"nm8803756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Emma Jones","asCharacter":"Amyas Amy"},{"id":"nm5754683","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjkwNDJiYmUtMjgzZi00ZTBjLThmMmEtNDhkZDY0YmQ3NjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDExNjMzNzU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jonathan K.
