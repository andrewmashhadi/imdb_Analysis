But no one seems to notice except for Patricia \"Pat\" Phelps ( Courteney Cox), who's convinced she's either depressed or possessed - turns out, the symptoms are exactly the same. Pat s a former \"wild child\" who rose to fame by writing a raunchy, drug-and-alcohol-soaked women's empowerment novel (a.k.a. lady porn). Fast forward 17 years later, Pat is clean and sober but totally unfulfilled. She still hasn't written her second novel, she can't remember the last time she had sex with her husband, Terry ( Greg Kinnear), and her teenage kids Gaynor ( Gus Birney) and Jake (Dylan Gage) are at that stage where they want you dead. She was a faithful wife until her one slip-up: she had a torrid affair with the hot, young handyman who came over to fix the sink while Terry was at work. In a last-ditch effort to save their marriage, she and Terry cash in all their savings and move the family move from the \"crazy\" of the city to a large, old house in the suburbs that has a storied past of its own. Everyone has their demons, but for Pat Phelps, they may be real.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Courteney Cox, Greg Kinnear, Gus Birney","starList":[{"id":"nm0001073","name":"Courteney Cox"},{"id":"nm0001427","name":"Greg Kinnear"},{"id":"nm6262342","name":"Gus Birney"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001073","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA4OTczNDExNDNeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDUyNTIzMTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Courteney Cox","asCharacter":"Patricia 'Pat' Phelpsas Patricia 'Pat' Phelps…"},{"id":"nm0001427","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNzE5MDM1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTAzMjM3NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Greg Kinnear","asCharacter":"Terry Phelpsas Terry Phelps"},{"id":"nm6262342","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDBiYjI5ZWYtYWE0YS00NTljLTlhYTMtYjk3ZWNjYzE4MjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjA1NTM2MDQ@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gus Birney","asCharacter":"Gaynor Phelpsas Gaynor Phelps"},{"id":"nm8578280","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDFmMGQwMjktZGVmZC00MGU2LWE0MzktN2E0NTY0MWE3YjZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzk0MzU3NjY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dylan Gage","asCharacter":"Jake Phelpsas Jake Phelps"},{"id":"nm0000227","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzhmZjVjYTMtODRkYS00MTFjLWE0NDAtMDk5Mzk2M2JhNDliXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTkxMDEwMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mira Sorvino","asCharacter":"Rosemaryas Rosemary"},{"id":"nm0242257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzY1YzBhYzItYzZhZi00MmEyLTgwZGEtYjE4OTVmMjYzNzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Merrin Dungey","asCharacter":"Kamas Kam"},{"id":"nm11221274","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmFiYzhlY2UtNzg2Ni00NTIxLTliOTEtMWVjYWI2NGQ2ZDIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI4ODI4NTcz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Derek Luh","asCharacter":"Ryanas Ryan"},{"id":"nm1130496","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTg3YzdhZGItOTUxZi00ZjJiLTgzYjQtNzkwMDg4NzM2NTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjE2OTgzMTc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alysia Reiner","asCharacter":"Kathrynas Kathryn"},{"id":"nm2895488","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGM2ODI3NDktMjVkMS00YTE0LTljMGItYzk4ZWViYjJlZWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA1NjA1ODM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Susan Park","asCharacter":"Valerie Heas Valerie He"},{"id":"nm0175415","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNDQ0Nzg4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI2NDIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James M.
