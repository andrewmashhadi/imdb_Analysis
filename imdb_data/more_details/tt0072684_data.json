Without an alternative, Barry joins the British Army to fight in the Seven Years War. He deserts and is forced to join the Prussian Army, where he saves the life of his Captain and becomes his protégé and spy of Irish gambler Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee). He helps Chevalier and becomes his associate until he decides to marry the wealthy Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). They move to England and Barry, in his obsession of nobility, dissipates her fortune and makes a dangerous and revengeful enemy.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #194 | Won 4 Oscars, 19 wins & 15 nominations total","directors":"Stanley Kubrick","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000040","name":"Stanley Kubrick"}],"writers":"Stanley Kubrick, William Makepeace Thackeray","writerList":[{"id":"nm0000040","name":"Stanley Kubrick"},{"id":"nm0856842","name":"William Makepeace Thackeray"}],"stars":"Ryan O'Neal, Marisa Berenson, Patrick Magee","starList":[{"id":"nm0641939","name":"Ryan O'Neal"},{"id":"nm0001943","name":"Marisa Berenson"},{"id":"nm0535861","name":"Patrick Magee"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0641939","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjUxOTMwMTI1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTUxMDkwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Ryan O'Neal","asCharacter":"Barry Lyndonas Barry Lyndon"},{"id":"nm0001943","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDM1NzY4ODMzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTQwMjY5Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Marisa Berenson","asCharacter":"Lady Honoria Lyndonas Lady Honoria Lyndon"},{"id":"nm0535861","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTRhMzg2N2UtN2E5ZC00MDI2LTljNDMtZTFlNWJiZGQyOWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzAwOTU1MTk@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Patrick Magee","asCharacter":"The Chevalier du Balibarias The Chevalier du Balibari"},{"id":"nm0473228","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOGQzM2EzYjYtOTViMy00ZDVjLTk4ZWEtYTRkZDdkZjBkMjE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.webp","name":"Hardy Krüger","asCharacter":"Capt.
