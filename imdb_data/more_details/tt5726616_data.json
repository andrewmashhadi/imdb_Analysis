It's the summer of 1983 in the north of Italy, and Elio Perlman (Timothée Chalamet), a precocious 17-year-old young man, spends his days in his family's 17th-century villa transcribing and playing classical music, reading, and flirting with his friend Marzia (Esther Garrel). Elio enjoys a close relationship with his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an eminent professor specializing in Greco-Roman culture, and his mother Annella (Amira Casar), a translator, who favor him with the fruits of high culture in a setting that overflows with natural delights. While Elio's sophistication and intellectual gifts suggest he is already a fully-fledged adult, there is much that yet remains innocent and unformed about him, particularly about matters of the heart. One day, Oliver (Armie Hammer), a 24-year-old American college graduate student working on his doctorate, arrives as the annual summer intern tasked with helping Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of the setting, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Oscar, 95 wins & 259 nominations total","directors":"Luca Guadagnino","directorList":[{"id":"nm0345174","name":"Luca Guadagnino"}],"writers":"James Ivory, André Aciman","writerList":[{"id":"nm0412465","name":"James Ivory"},{"id":"nm6056595","name":"André Aciman"}],"stars":"Armie Hammer, Timothée Chalamet, Michael Stuhlbarg","starList":[{"id":"nm2309517","name":"Armie Hammer"},{"id":"nm3154303","name":"Timothée Chalamet"},{"id":"nm0836121","name":"Michael Stuhlbarg"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2309517","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzI3NTYwMzIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI1ODY1NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Armie Hammer","asCharacter":"Oliveras Oliver"},{"id":"nm3154303","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWU1Nzg0M2ItYjEzMi00ODliLThkODAtNGEyYzRkZTBmMmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDk2Mzk2NDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Timothée Chalamet","asCharacter":"Elioas Elio"},{"id":"nm0836121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjdjNTlhZjUtODA0MC00Mjc3LWExNmMtZDc5ZmI0ZmNlZWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Stuhlbarg","asCharacter":"Mr. Perlmanas Mr. Perlman"},{"id":"nm0142972","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzOTAyMDg4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA5OTExMDI@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Amira Casar","asCharacter":"Annella Perlmanas Annella Perlman"},{"id":"nm1081257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4ODE0MDcwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU5NTIxNDM@._V1_Ratio1.8571_AL_.jpg","name":"Esther Garrel","asCharacter":"Marziaas Marzia"},{"id":"nm4973460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Victoire Du Bois","asCharacter":"Chiaraas Chiara"},{"id":"nm8747928","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Vanda Capriolo","asCharacter":"Mafaldaas Mafalda"},{"id":"nm8747929","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Antonio Rimoldi","asCharacter":"Anchiseas Anchise"},{"id":"nm1997283","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Elena Bucci","asCharacter":"Bambi -
