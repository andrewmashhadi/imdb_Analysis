The shows narrator, a cowboy named Santee, selects a viewers question from a mailbag each week and answers it only as Santee can. Masterfully blending the fact filled story line being told with a unique comedic twist that only they can deliver , the Ghostriders present the viewers answer very much in the manner of how Monty Python's troop would. American Western history was never this much fun and entertaining.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"John Scott, Jaime Kornacki, Rick McMahan","starList":[{"id":"nm6601642","name":"John Scott"},{"id":"nm11248172","name":"Jaime Kornacki"},{"id":"nm8445744","name":"Rick McMahan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm6601642","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Scott","asCharacter":"Santeeas Santee"},{"id":"nm11248172","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jaime Kornacki","asCharacter":"Jaimeas Jaime"},{"id":"nm8445744","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjcyZWJmYjMtZTEyNS00MTdmLThiNTEtM2YwNGU2OTJmOWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTIyNjcyMDY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rick McMahan","asCharacter":"Grubbyas Grubby"},{"id":"nm7113969","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Danny K.
