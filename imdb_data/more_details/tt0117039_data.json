His tactics include what is now recognized as urban guerrilla tactics and organized assassinations of those Irish who work as informers for the UK government, and later members of British intelligence. Although Collins is conflicted about the necessity of this violent course, by 1921 the British are willing to negotiate. Sinn Fein President Eamon de Valera sends a reluctant Collins to London to negotiate a settlement. When Collins returns with a compromise of a partitioned Ireland and an Irish Free State, not a Republic, within the British Empire he is vilified by de Valera and repudiated by lifelong friend Harry Boland after Boland learns that his girlfriend Kitty Kiernan is in love with Collins. Collins is now faced with civil war as he struggles against those who insist on complete and unconditional independence for all of Ireland.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 4 wins & 17 nominations total","directors":"Neil Jordan","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001403","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"writers":"Neil Jordan","writerList":[{"id":"nm0001403","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"stars":"Liam Neeson, Aidan Quinn, Julia Roberts","starList":[{"id":"nm0000553","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"id":"nm0001644","name":"Aidan Quinn"},{"id":"nm0000210","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000553","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1MTQ3NzU1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE3Mjg0MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Liam Neeson","asCharacter":"Michael Collinsas Michael Collins"},{"id":"nm0001644","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwNTI3NzI5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDE1NTk0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aidan Quinn","asCharacter":"Harry Bolandas Harry Boland"},{"id":"nm0000210","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzNjU3MDczN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzY2Njc4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Julia Roberts","asCharacter":"Kitty Kiernanas Kitty Kiernan"},{"id":"nm0001324","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwMTQ2MjI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjUxNDMz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ian Hart","asCharacter":"Joe O'Reillyas Joe O'Reilly"},{"id":"nm0409023","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Richard Ingram","asCharacter":"British Officeras British Officer"},{"id":"nm0448584","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"John Kenny","asCharacter":"Patrick Pearseas Patrick Pearse"},{"id":"nm0564601","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ronan McCairbre","asCharacter":"Thomas MacDonaghas Thomas MacDonagh"},{"id":"nm0641596","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxMzY5MjcyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjE1MTky._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jer O'Leary","asCharacter":"Thomas Clarkeas Thomas Clarke"},{"id":"nm0245516","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDFkODdhZDYtMGUyZC00NTNjLWEwMjktOTZiODMyNzIxMTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Dwyer","asCharacter":"James Connollyas James Connolly"},{"id":"nm0614496","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Martin Murphy","asCharacter":"Captain Lee-Wilsonas Captain Lee-Wilson"},{"id":"nm0000614","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwNTc4MTg4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDY2MjkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alan Rickman","asCharacter":"Eamon de Valeraas Eamon de Valera"},{"id":"nm0569336","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwMzg3MDc3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU1MjQ3Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sean McGinley","asCharacter":"Smithas Smith"},{"id":"nm0924030","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIxNjYyNjYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk0MTk0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Gary Whelan","asCharacter":"Hoeyas Hoey"},{"id":"nm0642751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Frank O'Sullivan","asCharacter":"Kavanaghas Kavanagh"},{"id":"nm0001653","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE5NDU5NDQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDE1NDgz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stephen Rea","asCharacter":"Ned Broyas Ned Broy"},{"id":"nm0491947","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjUwODEyMDUyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcwNTgzNzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Frank Laverty","asCharacter":"Sean McKeoinas Sean McKeoin"},{"id":"nm0642269","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Owen O'Neill","asCharacter":"Rory O'Connoras Rory O'Connor"},{"id":"nm0334324","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmE4ODdiZmUtNWMxNC00ZjdkLThhNzQtNTIyNTA4MzA4ODQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Stuart Graham","asCharacter":"Tom Cullenas Tom Cullen"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Biography, Drama, Thriller","genreList":[{"key":"Biography","value":"Biography"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Thriller","value":"Thriller"}],"companies":"Warner Bros., Geffen Pictures, Irish Film Board","companyList":[{"id":"co0002663","name":"Warner Bros."},{"id":"co0120075","name":"Geffen Pictures"},{"id":"co0841075","name":"Irish Film Board"}],"countries":"USA, Ireland","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"},{"key":"Ireland","value":"Ireland"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"7.1","imDbRatingVotes":"31391","metacriticRating":"60","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$25,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$182,221","grossUSA":"$11,092,559","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$11,135,803"},"tagline":"Ireland, 1916.
