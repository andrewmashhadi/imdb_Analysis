He is hardly a model child; mean-spirited and incorrigible. One day, he is adopted by a loving man along with his obnoxious wife named Ben Healy and Flo Healy. Ever since Junior comes into their lives, he turns ordinary days into full-scale comic nightmares! He also leaves a path of serious destruction in his wake, and is even pen pals with Martin Beck (A.K.A. The Bow Tie Killer, a notorious serial killer who kidnaps his faithful correspondent, along with Flo). And now it's up to Ben as he undertakes a rescue mission to get Junior back from Beck before he plans on hurting him.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"Dennis Dugan","directorList":[{"id":"nm0240797","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"writers":"Scott Alexander, Larry Karaszewski","writerList":[{"id":"nm0018735","name":"Scott Alexander"},{"id":"nm0438989","name":"Larry Karaszewski"}],"stars":"Michael Oliver, John Ritter, Jack Warden","starList":[{"id":"nm0646943","name":"Michael Oliver"},{"id":"nm0000615","name":"John Ritter"},{"id":"nm0912001","name":"Jack Warden"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0646943","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxNjgyODAxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczNTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.6571_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Oliver","asCharacter":"Junioras Junior"},{"id":"nm0000615","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNDkyMzUzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDMzNDgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Ritter","asCharacter":"Benas Ben"},{"id":"nm0912001","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc1Mjk3Njc5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk2MzUzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Warden","asCharacter":"Big Benas Big Ben"},{"id":"nm0331906","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjc2OTI1NDA3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU3MzE3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gilbert Gottfried","asCharacter":"Mr. Peabodyas Mr. Peabody"},{"id":"nm0001865","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwNjMyODk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFyZXN1bWU@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Amy Yasbeck","asCharacter":"Floas Flo"},{"id":"nm0724245","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg2NTI0MDk3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI1MTE0NA@@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Richards","asCharacter":"Martin Beckas Martin Beck"},{"id":"nm0432867","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwMDkwNDU0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk2MDcyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Jurasik","asCharacter":"Royas Roy"},{"id":"nm0015356","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Charlotte Akin","asCharacter":"Lorraineas Lorraine"},{"id":"nm0021603","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Anna Marie Allred","asCharacter":"Kid #3as Kid #3"},{"id":"nm0025969","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Adam Anderly","asCharacter":"Catcheras Catcher"},{"id":"nm0027365","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Robert A.
