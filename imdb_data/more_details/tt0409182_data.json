A small group of survivors find themselves unlikely allies in a battle for their lives. Preferring to test the odds alone, career gambler Dylan Johns ignores captain's orders to wait below for possible rescue and sets out to find his own way to safety. What begins as a solo mission soon draws others, as Dylan is followed by a desperate father searching for his daughter and her fiancée--a young couple who hours before couldn't summon the courage to tell him they were engaged and now face much graver challenges. Along the way they are joined by a single mother and her wise-beyond-his-years son, an anxious stowaway and a despondent fellow passenger who boarded the ship not sure he wanted to live but now knows he doesn't want to die. Determined to fight their way to the surface, the group sets off through the disorienting maze of twisted steel in the upside-down wreckage. As the unstable vessel rapidly fills with water each must draw on skills and strengths they didn't even know they possessed, fighting against time for their own survival and for each other.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 7 nominations total","directors":"Wolfgang Petersen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000583","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"writers":"Mark Protosevich, Paul Gallico","writerList":[{"id":"nm0698873","name":"Mark Protosevich"},{"id":"nm0302904","name":"Paul Gallico"}],"stars":"Richard Dreyfuss, Kurt Russell, Emmy Rossum","starList":[{"id":"nm0000377","name":"Richard Dreyfuss"},{"id":"nm0000621","name":"Kurt Russell"},{"id":"nm0002536","name":"Emmy Rossum"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000377","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUzMjIzMjM2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAxMDY0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Dreyfuss","asCharacter":"Richard Nelsonas Richard Nelson"},{"id":"nm0000621","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk3MjkxNzQwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDk4ODM1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kurt Russell","asCharacter":"Robert Ramseyas Robert Ramsey"},{"id":"nm0002536","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWU2ZmUyOTctNjE0Zi00N2Q3LTk1ZmYtMzAxMDRmNmM3OTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU1Nzk5NTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emmy Rossum","asCharacter":"Jennifer Ramseyas Jennifer Ramsey"},{"id":"nm0524197","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE5MTQxMzc1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcxMjA3NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Josh Lucas","asCharacter":"Dylan Johnsas Dylan Johns"},{"id":"nm0057150","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA3NjE2NzA4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ3NzUxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jacinda Barrett","asCharacter":"Maggie Jamesas Maggie James"},{"id":"nm0535502","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4MDMxNTg1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NjIxMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mía Maestro","asCharacter":"Elena Moralesas Elena Morales"},{"id":"nm1036181","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNDIzMTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk1NjEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Vogel","asCharacter":"Christianas Christian"},{"id":"nm0001143","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1Njg4NTEwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODU0ODcz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Dillon","asCharacter":"Lucky Larryas Lucky Larry"},{"id":"nm0135585","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzMDA2MTA4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQzNDI0ODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","asCharacter":"Marco Valentinas Marco Valentin"},{"id":"nm1497548","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTNiODNlZGEtZTlkOC00MzcyLThjYTMtZjhiNzNlMzY2OTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwNjAyMjc5._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jimmy Bennett","asCharacter":"Conor Jamesas Conor James"},{"id":"nm0004914","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwNzExMTU1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODkyMjIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fergie","asCharacter":"Gloriaas Gloria"},{"id":"nm0105672","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIyNTIwOTY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTE2NzU3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andre Braugher","asCharacter":"Captain Bradfordas Captain Bradford"},{"id":"nm0938570","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjkwOWI3NjgtNDhmZS00MWI5LTgxNDctZTJjYjg1MWYwYmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kirk B.R.
