When lawyer Mitch Brenner sees her in a pet shop, he plays something of a practical joke on her, and she decides to return the favor. She drives about an hour north of San Francisco to Bodega Bay, where Mitch spends the weekends with his mother Lydia and younger sister Cathy. Soon after her arrival, however, the birds in the area begin to act strangely. A seagull attacks Melanie as she is crossing the bay in a small boat, and then, Lydia finds her neighbor dead, obviously the victim of a bird attack. Soon, birds in the hundreds and thousands are attacking anyone they find out of doors. There is no explanation as to why this might be happening, and as the birds continue their vicious attacks, survival becomes the priority.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 5 wins & 7 nominations total","directors":"Alfred Hitchcock","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000033","name":"Alfred Hitchcock"}],"writers":"Daphne Du Maurier, Evan Hunter","writerList":[{"id":"nm0238898","name":"Daphne Du Maurier"},{"id":"nm0402805","name":"Evan Hunter"}],"stars":"Rod Taylor, Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy","starList":[{"id":"nm0001792","name":"Rod Taylor"},{"id":"nm0001335","name":"Tippi Hedren"},{"id":"nm0001788","name":"Jessica Tandy"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001792","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyMTY0MTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUxNjU5MzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rod Taylor","asCharacter":"Mitch Brenneras Mitch Brenner"},{"id":"nm0001335","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjAwNjIzMTk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTM0NTk3._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tippi Hedren","asCharacter":"Melanie Danielsas Melanie Daniels"},{"id":"nm0001788","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0NjUyODQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5ODgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jessica Tandy","asCharacter":"Lydia Brenneras Lydia Brenner"},{"id":"nm0687189","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NzkwMjA3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkwNTgy._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Suzanne Pleshette","asCharacter":"Annie Hayworthas Annie Hayworth"},{"id":"nm0001021","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTg2NDE0MDkyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI1MzUyMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Veronica Cartwright","asCharacter":"Cathy Brenneras Cathy Brenner"},{"id":"nm0341100","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2ODA1NTMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNTAxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ethel Griffies","asCharacter":"Mrs. Bundyas Mrs. Bundy"},{"id":"nm0569902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkyOTU0MDI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY0MTMxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles McGraw","asCharacter":"Sebastian Sholesas Sebastian Sholes"},{"id":"nm0567599","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM1MzY0OTA0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY0NDYxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ruth McDevitt","asCharacter":"Mrs. MacGruderas Mrs. MacGruder"},{"id":"nm0152452","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWRjYmZjZmMtYWZjMS00N2UwLWI2YTYtNjRmOTE3ZWE5NzYwL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lonny Chapman","asCharacter":"Deke Carteras Deke Carter"},{"id":"nm0544064","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxNjM2NjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUxMTIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Joe Mantell","asCharacter":"Traveling Salesman at Diner's Baras Traveling Salesman at Diner's Bar"},{"id":"nm0915845","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAyMjU0OTYyNTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDc0ODMwMjg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Doodles Weaver","asCharacter":"Fisherman Helping with Rental Boatas Fisherman Helping with Rental Boat"},{"id":"nm0041021","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwNTczMzE3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQzNzUyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Malcolm Atterbury","asCharacter":"Deputy Al Maloneas Deputy Al Malone"},{"id":"nm0569569","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGM3ZDlkZWEtZDUwNC00Y2ViLTk3ZWMtYjZkYTJkMTczZDlkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.8571_AL_.jpg","name":"John McGovern","asCharacter":"Postal Clerkas Postal Clerk"},{"id":"nm0842425","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NzEwMzE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDI0ODkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Karl Swenson","asCharacter":"Drunken Doomsayer in Dineras Drunken Doomsayer in Diner"},{"id":"nm0212586","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjkyMjczMzUxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ2MzgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Deacon","asCharacter":"Mitch's City Neighboras Mitch's City Neighbor"},{"id":"nm0933361","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjExMzQ5NTAwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc2NzY2NTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Elizabeth Wilson","asCharacter":"Helen Carteras Helen Carter"},{"id":"nm0703767","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTkyNjk2MDI2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQ3MTM0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Quinn","asCharacter":"Samas Sam"},{"id":"nm0485729","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMmE2N2U1YmUtOGQ3Mi00Y2EzLWI1MWItNmMxMjc4YThlZmMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Doreen Lang","asCharacter":"Hysterical Mother in Dineras Hysterical Mother in Diner"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Horror, Mystery","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Horror","value":"Horror"},{"key":"Mystery","value":"Mystery"}],"companies":"Alfred J.
