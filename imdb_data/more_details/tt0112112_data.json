The bulk of their work is prevention and petty crime, such as pickpockets and purse-snatchers, but of course the more spectacular atypical cases, often one-offs, sometimes even involving the FBI, get extra attention. No less attention is paid to the relationships between all these hotshots (some change during the series), young and ambitious, sexy and horny, so there's lots of temptation, amorous and professional rivalry, conflicting personal and professional interests. Of course this causes most worries for their commanding Lieutenant, usually the one who has to deal with the regular hierarchy above him, originally Anthony Palermo, later on the very former rookie who long gave him most cause for concern, Terence \"T.C.\" Callaway.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Jim Davidson, Paula Trickey, Darlene Vogel","starList":[{"id":"nm0203371","name":"Jim Davidson"},{"id":"nm0872632","name":"Paula Trickey"},{"id":"nm0900877","name":"Darlene Vogel"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0203371","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0Mjk0MzQxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3MTIzMjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Davidson","asCharacter":"T.C.
