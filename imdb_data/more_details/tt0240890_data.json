Though buying for their respective lovers, the magic was right and a night of Christmas shopping turned into romance. Jon wanted to explore things further but Sara wasn't sure their love was meant to be. They decided to test fate by splitting up and seeing if destiny brought them back together... Many years later, having lost each other that night, both are engaged to be married. Still, neither can shake the need to give fate one last chance to reunite them. Jon enlists the help of his best man to track down the girl he can't forget starting at the store where they met. Sara asks her new age musician fiance for a break before the wedding and, with her best friend in tow, flies from California to New York hoping destiny will bring her soulmate back. Near-misses and classic Shakespearean confusion bring the two close to meeting a number of times but fate will have the final word on whether it was meant to be.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 3 nominations","directors":"Peter Chelsom","directorList":[{"id":"nm0155093","name":"Peter Chelsom"}],"writers":"Marc Klein","writerList":[{"id":"nm0458884","name":"Marc Klein"}],"stars":"John Cusack, Kate Beckinsale, Jeremy Piven","starList":[{"id":"nm0000131","name":"John Cusack"},{"id":"nm0000295","name":"Kate Beckinsale"},{"id":"nm0005315","name":"Jeremy Piven"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000131","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODQ4ZjU4NWItM2RlMS00OWY3LWJhZjAtYmQ3NjRiMzA5YjdjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTAyMDgxODQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Cusack","asCharacter":"Jonathan Trageras Jonathan Trager"},{"id":"nm0000295","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM3MzY2MDYwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQ3MDA0Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kate Beckinsale","asCharacter":"Sara Thomasas Sara Thomas"},{"id":"nm0005315","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUwMDQ0NjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA1NzMxNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeremy Piven","asCharacter":"Dean Kanskyas Dean Kansky"},{"id":"nm0005256","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0Nzc3ODE3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQxOTU3MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bridget Moynahan","asCharacter":"Halley Buchananas Halley Buchanan"},{"id":"nm0506405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NTQ5NjA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDgwMjQ1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eugene Levy","asCharacter":"Bloomingdale's Salesmanas Bloomingdale's Salesman"},{"id":"nm0492107","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lilli Lavine","asCharacter":"Bloomingdale's Stock Girlas Bloomingdale's Stock Girl"},{"id":"nm0345380","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Guarino Jr.","asCharacter":"Customer At Bloomingdale'sas Customer At Bloomingdale's"},{"id":"nm1152476","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Abdul Alshawish","asCharacter":"Customer At Bloomingdale'sas Customer At Bloomingdale's"},{"id":"nm1056824","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Stephen Bruce","asCharacter":"Host At Serendipityas Host At Serendipity"},{"id":"nm0817102","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIwODM0NTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk1MTAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Sparrow","asCharacter":"Josh's Dadas Josh's Dad"},{"id":"nm0848244","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY0NzUwNjk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4OTcyMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ann Talman","asCharacter":"Bloomingdale's Saleswoman #1as Bloomingdale's Saleswoman #1"},{"id":"nm0090640","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWE0ZTMxM2ItZjI0Zi00MmI2LThhZDAtMmViN2IwMGExOTg4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjIyOTYxODY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Crystal Bock","asCharacter":"Bloomingdale's Saleswoman #2as Bloomingdale's Saleswoman #2"},{"id":"nm1055484","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gary Gerbrandt","asCharacter":"Joshas Josh"},{"id":"nm1002960","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MTYxMDc0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTY5NzQwMg@@._V1_Ratio1.2429_AL_.jpg","name":"Kate Blumberg","asCharacter":"Courtneyas Courtney"},{"id":"nm0668421","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ron Payne","asCharacter":"Louis Trageras Louis Trager"},{"id":"nm0071904","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTZhODJlYTQtMDJmZS00NTc2LWFjYmUtMWQzODg2Yzc2ZDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY5ODExNA@@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marcia Bennett","asCharacter":"Mrs. Trageras Mrs. Trager"},{"id":"nm0950142","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Victor A.
