She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, an overweight man with Asperger's, living alone in New York. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #203 | Awards, 5 wins & 9 nominations","directors":"Adam Elliot","directorList":[{"id":"nm0254178","name":"Adam Elliot"}],"writers":"Adam Elliot","writerList":[{"id":"nm0254178","name":"Adam Elliot"}],"stars":"Toni Collette, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Eric Bana","starList":[{"id":"nm0001057","name":"Toni Collette"},{"id":"nm0000450","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman"},{"id":"nm0051509","name":"Eric Bana"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001057","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODYzOTE3ODc1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODYwMjE4NTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Toni Collette","asCharacter":"Mary Daisy Dinkleas Mary Daisy Dinkle"},{"id":"nm0000450","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ0NTA1NTg3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkxNzgxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","asCharacter":"Max Jerry Horovitzas Max Jerry Horovitz"},{"id":"nm0051509","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzM4MjY5YjctMWQzNy00MjczLTg1MGMtOTIxZWU4NGVmMWQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzAxOTAyMDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Eric Bana","asCharacter":"Damien Popodopolousas Damien Popodopolous"},{"id":"nm0402032","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3Mjk5NDI4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg4NjUzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Barry Humphries","asCharacter":"Narratoras Narrator"},{"id":"nm1814260","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc2Mzg3NTEzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc2MDIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Massey","asCharacter":"911 Operatoras 911 Operator"},{"id":"nm8784422","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Oliver Marks","asCharacter":"Alleyway Bully Oneas Alleyway Bully One"},{"id":"nm8784423","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Daisy Kocher","asCharacter":"Alleyway Bully Twoas Alleyway Bully Two"},{"id":"nm10928013","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Daniel Marks","asCharacter":"Alleyway Bully Threeas Alleyway Bully Three"},{"id":"nm0400635","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hamish Hughes","asCharacter":"Animals (Miscellaneous)as Animals (Miscellaneous)"},{"id":"nm0230555","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Dan Doherty","asCharacter":"BMX Banditas BMX Bandit"},{"id":"nm0287054","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Julie Forsyth","asCharacter":"Bus Stop Motheras Bus Stop Mother"},{"id":"nm10928014","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mandy Mao","asCharacter":"Cher the Chihuahuaas Cher the Chihuahua"},{"id":"nm3370641","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2JlMDNmODUtNjAxYi00MWJlLWFiYmQtYTRlYzM2NTYyYzRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjEzMDEyMTQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick McCabe","asCharacter":"Datsun Sunny Driveras Datsun Sunny Driver"},{"id":"nm0254178","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDg2NTU4MTQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2NTAzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Adam Elliot","asCharacter":"Dr. Bernard Hazelhofas Dr. Bernard Hazelhof"},{"id":"nm10928015","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mr. Peck","asCharacter":"Ethel the Roosteras Ethel the Rooster"},{"id":"nm3369388","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael James Allen","asCharacter":"Ferrari Driveras Ferrari Driver"},{"id":"nm0614107","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bill Murphy","asCharacter":"Frankston Icebreaker Oneas Frankston Icebreaker One"},{"id":"nm1993815","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Shaun Patten","asCharacter":"Frankston Icebreaker Twoas Frankston Icebreaker Two"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Animation, Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Animation","value":"Animation"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Melodrama Pictures","companyList":[{"id":"co0112023","name":"Melodrama Pictures"}],"countries":"Australia","countryList":[{"key":"Australia","value":"Australia"}],"languages":"English, Yiddish","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"Yiddish","value":"Yiddish"}],"contentRating":"Not Rated","imDbRating":"8.1","imDbRatingVotes":"174713","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"A$8,240,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$1,740,429"},"tagline":"Two unlikely people.
