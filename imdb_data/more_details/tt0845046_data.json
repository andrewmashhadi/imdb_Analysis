Set on a long English summer in the early '80s, SON OF RAMBOW is a comedy about friendship, faith and the tough business of growing up. We see the story through the eyes of Will, the eldest son of a fatherless Plymouth Brethren family. The Brethren regard themselves as God's 'chosen ones' and their strict moral code means that Will has never been allowed to mix with the other 'worldlies,' listen to music or watch TV, until he finds himself caught up in the extraordinary world of Lee Carter, the school terror and maker of bizarre home movies. Carter exposes Will to a pirate copy of Rambo: First Blood and from that moment Will's mind is blown wide open and he's easily convinced to be the stuntman in Lee Carters' diabolical home movie. Will's imaginative little brain is not only given chance to flourish in the world of film making, but is also very handy when it comes to dreaming up elaborate schemes to keep his partnership with Lee Carter a secret from the Brethren community. Will and Carter's complete disregard for consequences and innocent ambition means that the process of making their film is a glorious roller-coaster that eventually leads to true friendship. They start to make a name for themselves at school as movie makers but when popularity descends on them in the form of the Pied Piper-esque French exchange student, Didier Revol, their unique friendship and their precious film are pushed, quite literally, to breaking point.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 BAFTA Award, 3 wins & 10 nominations total","directors":"Garth Jennings","directorList":[{"id":"nm1134029","name":"Garth Jennings"}],"writers":"Garth Jennings","writerList":[{"id":"nm1134029","name":"Garth Jennings"}],"stars":"Bill Milner, Will Poulter, Jessica Hynes","starList":[{"id":"nm2389463","name":"Bill Milner"},{"id":"nm2401020","name":"Will Poulter"},{"id":"nm0828961","name":"Jessica Hynes"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2389463","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNjkyMTc0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzY0NDkzODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Milner","asCharacter":"Will Proudfootas Will Proudfoot"},{"id":"nm2401020","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGM5Y2IxNmYtODg5Zi00YjZhLThkZDUtMGE1ODc4N2MyZjAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNzQzMDE0._V1_Ratio1.2286_AL_.jpg","name":"Will Poulter","asCharacter":"Lee Carteras Lee Carter"},{"id":"nm0828961","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ5ODg2MDI5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQ2MDQ4NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jessica Hynes","asCharacter":"Mary Proudfootas Mary Proudfoot"},{"id":"nm0934923","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Anna Wing","asCharacter":"Grandmaas Grandma"},{"id":"nm0240072","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2OTMzNzA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTk4NTgwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Neil Dudgeon","asCharacter":"Joshuaas Joshua"},{"id":"nm2368268","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzViYzQyNjYtZTIyMC00NDA5LTgwZWQtNTZjY2UyODUyOTkwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tallulah Evans","asCharacter":"Jess Proudfootas Jess Proudfoot"},{"id":"nm0156226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Emilie Chesnais","asCharacter":"French Teacheras French Teacher"},{"id":"nm0728795","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUyNTcwNDUxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc1MDcxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Ritter","asCharacter":"Geography Teacheras Geography Teacher"},{"id":"nm2987799","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Finola McMahon","asCharacter":"Gail Grahamas Gail Graham"},{"id":"nm2987757","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Rachel Mureatroyd","asCharacter":"Marie Planteas Marie Plante"},{"id":"nm2988248","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Taylor Richardson","asCharacter":"David Smartas David Smart"},{"id":"nm2988237","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Robinson","asCharacter":"Lucas Dupontas Lucas Dupont"},{"id":"nm2447405","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Charlie Thrift","asCharacter":"Duncan Milleras Duncan Miller"},{"id":"nm0803262","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE1NTU5MTM4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTE1MTk1MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.5143_AL_.jpg","name":"Jules Sitruk","asCharacter":"Didier Revolas Didier Revol"},{"id":"nm2987734","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sam Kubrick-Finney","asCharacter":"Dannyas Danny"},{"id":"nm2988061","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzliYTRhNDctYWZlNy00MzRkLThlNGYtMWE1MTViZGZmNTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Clarke","asCharacter":"Shaunas Shaun"},{"id":"nm2484905","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Zofia Brooks","asCharacter":"Tinaas Tina"},{"id":"nm0649876","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Denise Orita","asCharacter":"Orderlyas Orderly"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Action, Adventure, Comedy","genreList":[{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"}],"companies":"Hammer & Tongs, Celluloid Dreams, Good Film Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0104360","name":"Hammer & Tongs"},{"id":"co0075896","name":"Celluloid Dreams"},{"id":"co0168621","name":"Good Film Productions"}],"countries":"UK, France, Germany, USA","countryList":[{"key":"UK","value":"UK"},{"key":"France","value":"France"},{"key":"Germany","value":"Germany"},{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English, French","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"}],"contentRating":"PG-13","imDbRating":"7","imDbRatingVotes":"31771","metacriticRating":"66","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"Â£4,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$53,789","grossUSA":"$1,785,505","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$10,871,449"},"tagline":"Make Believe.
