Her son insists she allow him to hire a driver, which in the 1950s meant a black man. She resists any change in her life but, Hoke, the driver is hired by her son. She refuses to allow him to drive her anywhere at first, but Hoke slowly wins her over with his native good graces. The movie is directly taken from a stage play and does show it. It covers over twenty years of the pair's life together as they slowly build a relationship that transcends their differences.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 4 Oscars, 21 wins & 24 nominations total","directors":"Bruce Beresford","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000915","name":"Bruce Beresford"}],"writers":"Alfred Uhry","writerList":[{"id":"nm0880261","name":"Alfred Uhry"}],"stars":"Morgan Freeman, Jessica Tandy, Dan Aykroyd","starList":[{"id":"nm0000151","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"id":"nm0001788","name":"Jessica Tandy"},{"id":"nm0000101","name":"Dan Aykroyd"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000151","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc0MDMyMzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzM2OTk1MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Morgan Freeman","asCharacter":"Hoke Colburnas Hoke Colburn"},{"id":"nm0001788","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0NjUyODQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzA5ODgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jessica Tandy","asCharacter":"Daisy Werthanas Daisy Werthan"},{"id":"nm0000101","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI2MDA3NTg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM5ODgz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dan Aykroyd","asCharacter":"Boolie Werthanas Boolie Werthan"},{"id":"nm0526985","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjAzZjU5MGItOGI2Ni00ODU1LWFhZTctYTlhMTNlNWRhMDI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patti LuPone","asCharacter":"Florine Werthanas Florine Werthan"},{"id":"nm0738354","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAzMzc0NTQ3ODBeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDQwNDEzNg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Esther Rolle","asCharacter":"Idellaas Idella"},{"id":"nm0369908","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jo Ann Havrilla","asCharacter":"Miss McClatcheyas Miss McClatchey"},{"id":"nm0355253","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"William Hall Jr.","asCharacter":"Oscaras Oscar"},{"id":"nm0837393","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alvin M.
