Kennedy, he became one of the few Agents to have lost a President to an assassin when Kennedy died. Now, former C.I.A. assassin Mitch Leary (John Malkovich) is stalking the current President (Jim Curley), who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the President because Leary feels betrayed by the government. Leary was removed from the C.I.A., and the C.I.A. is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to Presidential protection duty, working with fellow Secret Service Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo). Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he's more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent (Fred Dalton Thompson) refuses to alter the President's itinerary, while Horrigan's boss, Secret Service Director Sam Campagna (John Mahoney), is supportive of Horrigan. As the election gets closer, Horrigan begins to doubt his own abilities, especially when Horrigan's colleague Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott) is killed by Leary. But Horrigan may be the only one who can stop Leary.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 3 Oscars, 2 wins & 17 nominations total","directors":"Wolfgang Petersen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000583","name":"Wolfgang Petersen"}],"writers":"Jeff Maguire","writerList":[{"id":"nm0536587","name":"Jeff Maguire"}],"stars":"Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo","starList":[{"id":"nm0000142","name":"Clint Eastwood"},{"id":"nm0000518","name":"John Malkovich"},{"id":"nm0000623","name":"Rene Russo"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000142","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3MDc0MjY0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzU1MDAxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Clint Eastwood","asCharacter":"Frank Horriganas Frank Horrigan"},{"id":"nm0000518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwMDM5ODUwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzEwOTI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Malkovich","asCharacter":"Mitch Learyas Mitch Leary"},{"id":"nm0000623","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjE4MDk2ODY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTc0Mjk2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rene Russo","asCharacter":"Lilly Rainesas Lilly Raines"},{"id":"nm0001518","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMjY2NzU4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg2NDc4Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dylan McDermott","asCharacter":"Al D'Andreaas Al D'Andrea"},{"id":"nm0170550","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQwODU5MTU3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzk2NzMzMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gary Cole","asCharacter":"Bill Wattsas Bill Watts"},{"id":"nm0000669","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgyODM4MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEyNjQ0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fred Thompson","asCharacter":"Harry Sargentas Harry Sargent"},{"id":"nm0001498","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI3MDM1ODc5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjY0MDQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Mahoney","asCharacter":"Sam Campagnaas Sam Campagna"},{"id":"nm0930707","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQyOTc5OTM3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyOTUzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gregory Alan Williams","asCharacter":"Matt Wilderas Matt Wilder"},{"id":"nm0192756","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI1MTM5OTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTAzMzEz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Curley","asCharacter":"Presidentas President"},{"id":"nm0400916","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYwMTgwNDk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEyMTM1NzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sally Hughes","asCharacter":"First Ladyas First Lady"},{"id":"nm0476226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDE0YjQyYmQtN2U0Yi00ZmYxLTgxYWItMzYwODc3NWMwYzEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Clyde Kusatsu","asCharacter":"Jack Okuraas Jack Okura"},{"id":"nm0405337","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE5MTE3NDc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzE3MDE2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Steve Hytner","asCharacter":"Tony Carduccias Tony Carducci"},{"id":"nm0068551","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjM5OTE1MjA3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAxNjk4MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tobin Bell","asCharacter":"Mendozaas Mendoza"},{"id":"nm0774926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGU5NTdmYTgtODY2Ni00YTRkLTk4NTItMGFmNTk2ZjdjZWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.7714_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Schott","asCharacter":"Jimmy Hendricksonas Jimmy Hendrickson"},{"id":"nm0727823","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Juan A.
