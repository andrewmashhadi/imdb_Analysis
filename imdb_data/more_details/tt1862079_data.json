Along with Jeff, the staff writer, and Arnau, a fellow intern, the three go on a road trip to a coastal town. While Jeff just wants to chase after his high school crush and Arnau wants some kind of life experience, Darius spends her time with Kenneth, a man who believes that he has built a time machine. The closer they become and the more they understand about each other, the less clear it becomes if Kenneth is just crazy or if he actually is going to successfully travel back in time.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 8 wins & 18 nominations","directors":"Colin Trevorrow","directorList":[{"id":"nm1119880","name":"Colin Trevorrow"}],"writers":"Derek Connolly","writerList":[{"id":"nm2081046","name":"Derek Connolly"}],"stars":"Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson","starList":[{"id":"nm2201555","name":"Aubrey Plaza"},{"id":"nm0243233","name":"Mark Duplass"},{"id":"nm2159926","name":"Jake Johnson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2201555","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIyMzYyMjQ5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA0MTkxNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aubrey Plaza","asCharacter":"Dariusas Darius"},{"id":"nm0243233","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzlhNjUwMTQtMWRlZC00N2VlLTk0MjctMjI0NmI2ZWRkMDkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA5MTEzMA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mark Duplass","asCharacter":"Kennethas Kenneth"},{"id":"nm2159926","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjExMzc5NDM0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU3MDU3OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jake Johnson","asCharacter":"Jeffas Jeff"},{"id":"nm4175221","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0NjQ1MTU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMzc1MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Karan Soni","asCharacter":"Arnauas Arnau"},{"id":"nm4649894","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lauren Carlos","asCharacter":"Young Dariusas Young Darius"},{"id":"nm1317797","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Basil Harris","asCharacter":"Restaurant Manageras Restaurant Manager"},{"id":"nm0707476","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5NDcwNjM1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTcwNjE5NA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Lynn Rajskub","asCharacter":"Bridgetas Bridget"},{"id":"nm1932967","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjA1NDY4MmEtNDY3Mi00YTExLWEzNTctYjY4Mzg2MjE2MTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODMyMzY4Mjc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Leo Schultz","asCharacter":"Coworkeras Coworker"},{"id":"nm0307531","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzY4MDE4OTk2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYxMzA2MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeff Garlin","asCharacter":"Mr. Brittas Mr. Britt"},{"id":"nm0355253","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"William Hall Jr.","asCharacter":"Shannonas Shannon"},{"id":"nm4999390","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Alice Hung","asCharacter":"Shift Manageras Shift Manager"},{"id":"nm3661921","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Hassan Cristos Messiah","asCharacter":"Boyfriend in Caras Boyfriend in Car"},{"id":"nm4471841","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Keli Schurman-Darby","asCharacter":"Girlfriend in Caras Girlfriend in Car"},{"id":"nm0074410","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxNTY0OTQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTUxNzQ0NDE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jenica Bergere","asCharacter":"Lizas Liz"},{"id":"nm1119645","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjIyOGVjODEtNzBkNi00OTlmLThhNGYtNTVlOTI5Mzk1MmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODkzNTgxMDg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lynn Shelton","asCharacter":"Uptight Momas Uptight Mom"},{"id":"nm0414585","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peter Anthony Jacobs","asCharacter":"Deputy Sheriffas Deputy Sheriff"},{"id":"nm4844121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Eli Borozan","asCharacter":"Kid in Dineras Kid in Diner"},{"id":"nm4179366","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTg5NWUzNjQtMDg5MS00MDViLWI4OTMtYTU5YTM5OTMwODMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tom Ricciardelli","asCharacter":"Security Guardas Security Guard"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Adventure, Comedy, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"FilmDistrict, Big Beach Films, Duplass Brothers Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0314851","name":"FilmDistrict"},{"id":"co0148020","name":"Big Beach Films"},{"id":"co0152336","name":"Duplass Brothers Productions"}],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"6.9","imDbRatingVotes":"125259","metacriticRating":"72","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$750,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$97,762","grossUSA":"$4,010,957","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$4,424,699"},"tagline":"WANTED Someone to go back in time with me.
