Since that time, whenever he is under extreme stress, his body undergoes a transmogrification and he morphs into the Incredible Hulk. The Hulk is about seven feet tall, hugely muscular and powerful, and has bright green skin. After destroying whatever threatens Dr. Banner, he morphs back to normal human form with only amnesia and tattered clothing as evidence of what just transpired. As you can well imagine, this situation is quite troubling for Dr. Banner and causes him a great amount of problems. All the while, he is pursued by Jack McGee, an investigative reporter who believes that the Hulk is a deadly menace whose exposure would enhance his career.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy, 3 wins & 5 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno, Jack Colvin","starList":[{"id":"nm0084642","name":"Bill Bixby"},{"id":"nm0002073","name":"Lou Ferrigno"},{"id":"nm0173438","name":"Jack Colvin"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0084642","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTAwODEzOTI5ODleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDUzNDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bill Bixby","asCharacter":"Dr. David Banneras Dr. David Banner…"},{"id":"nm0002073","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM5NTcwNjQzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDI0MzM1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lou Ferrigno","asCharacter":"The Incredible Hulkas The Incredible Hulk…"},{"id":"nm0173438","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTYwNjk5ODgxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwODU0NDE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Jack Colvin","asCharacter":"Jack McGeeas Jack McGee"},{"id":"nm0621008","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyODc4NjY0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk1NTg4Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Napier","asCharacter":"Hulkas Hulk…"},{"id":"nm0763614","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Santiago","asCharacter":"Voiceas Voice…"},{"id":"nm0574468","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxMDY4NjQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTQ1ODgz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gerald McRaney","asCharacter":"Chief Frank Rhodesas Chief Frank Rhodes…"},{"id":"nm0681604","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDZlOGYxMzktNTFiYi00YTdiLThmN2QtYTcxZTVmYzcyMDJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ1Mzg1MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Charlie Picerni","asCharacter":"Charlieas Charlie…"},{"id":"nm0695222","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWJkOGFhMTQtODAyNi00YzMxLWFjYzYtZWQ1NGQ1MDE0MDAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTcyODY2NDQ@._V1_Ratio1.2000_AL_.jpg","name":"Laurie Prange","asCharacter":"Katie Maxwellas Katie Maxwell…"},{"id":"nm0015826","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQxNzQ4MDQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTkzMDk5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marc Alaimo","asCharacter":"Captain Holtas Captain Holt…"},{"id":"nm0111754","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODY0NzM3MzIxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk5NzU0NDE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Walter Brooke","asCharacter":"Mark Robertsas Mark Roberts"},{"id":"nm0428856","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTIxNzE2NjM0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc2NTcyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mickey Jones","asCharacter":"Docas Doc…"},{"id":"nm0942257","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMwNjIwOTUzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkwNjc3MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Bruce Wright","asCharacter":"Benas Ben…"},{"id":"nm0124100","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTdlYTY4NTAtYzRmMC00YjNhLWJlMDEtYzhhZmJiMmVjYzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Green Bush","asCharacter":"Sheriff Carl Deckeras Sheriff Carl Decker…"},{"id":"nm0785804","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNGQ5YmY0MDMtYzk2ZC00ZDQ1LWE3MDctNGE5N2MwOGI4NDA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc3NDgwNzU@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Eric Server","asCharacter":"Policemanas Policeman…"},{"id":"nm0550849","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI5MTA1MDg5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg4Mjk0MDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Don Marshall","asCharacter":"Doctoras Doctor…"},{"id":"nm0141027","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ2MTM1MjAxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ1OTQzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Victoria Carroll","asCharacter":"Roseas Rose…"},{"id":"nm0727172","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Skip Riley","asCharacter":"Pilotas Pilot…"},{"id":"nm0173304","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4MDkxNDk3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU2OTgzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"John Colton","asCharacter":"1st Manas 1st Man…"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Action, Adventure, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Action","value":"Action"},{"key":"Adventure","value":"Adventure"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"Universal Television","companyList":[{"id":"co0046592","name":"Universal Television"}],"countries":"","countryList":[],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":"TV-PG","imDbRating":"7","imDbRatingVotes":"13648","metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":"Don't make me angry.
