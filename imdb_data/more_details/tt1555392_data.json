Desolate images of Paifangs, mason lion statues, restaurants, gaming houses and supermarkets are captured in the early hours of the day, lit only by the eerie glow of the incandescent street lights and neon signs reflecting onto the cobblestone streets. The accompanying audio is taken from the relevant location at the opposite end of the day when the streets are at their liveliest.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Peter Sant","directorList":[{"id":"nm3711377","name":"Peter Sant"}],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"","starList":[],"actorList":[],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, News","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"News","value":"News"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"Australia, Belgium, UK","countryList":[{"key":"Australia","value":"Australia"},{"key":"Belgium","value":"Belgium"},{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"","languageList":[],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"non fiction","keywordList":["non fiction"],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
