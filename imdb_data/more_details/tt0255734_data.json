They get into all sorts of trouble, usually because of Sean's brother Eddie, who's got connections all over town. Sean and Eddie's father Walt often drops by and shares in the disaster. Most adventures are later recalled and they find out exactly what happened, like when the family car was supposedly stolen, when Sean's credit card was mysteriously maxed out, and even when Sean causes a blackout on Super Bowl Sunday. All this and more, and because Sean and Claudia were young and carefree when they got married and had kids, they are now grounded for life.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy, 1 win & 8 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Donal Logue, Megyn Price, Kevin Corrigan","starList":[{"id":"nm0006610","name":"Donal Logue"},{"id":"nm0697044","name":"Megyn Price"},{"id":"nm0180984","name":"Kevin Corrigan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0006610","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkxNzI1NjQxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzI0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Donal Logue","asCharacter":"Sean Finnertyas Sean Finnerty…"},{"id":"nm0697044","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwODMxNzU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgxMDYzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Megyn Price","asCharacter":"Claudia Finnertyas Claudia Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0180984","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA1OTc2NDU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI3Mjg4OA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kevin Corrigan","asCharacter":"Eddie Finnertyas Eddie Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0058723","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyNzIxOTE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODAxMzQzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Lynsey Bartilson","asCharacter":"Lily Finnertyas Lily Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0292480","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NzAxNjQyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDUxOTIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Griffin Frazen","asCharacter":"Jimmy Finnertyas Jimmy Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0120737","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYTBlNTI3OWQtOTBjYy00YjUyLWExODUtYmQ5MDRhZGE2YTBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jake Burbage","asCharacter":"Henry Finnertyas Henry Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0365501","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU3NjE2NjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ2MzQ1NjE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bret Harrison","asCharacter":"Brad O'Keefeas Brad O'Keefe"},{"id":"nm0726223","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjM0NjI0MTIyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzMxOTQ3NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Riehle","asCharacter":"Walt Finnertyas Walt Finnerty"},{"id":"nm0283565","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjk0OWZiNzctZTAwZC00NTFiLWJhYjQtNTgxNzljNTI4MjU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwODg2MDY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Miriam Flynn","asCharacter":"Sister Helenas Sister Helen"},{"id":"nm1036181","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkwNDIzMTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk1NjEzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mike Vogel","asCharacter":"Dean Piramattias Dean Piramatti"},{"id":"nm0419813","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzc0MDZjOTYtY2VhZi00NDYwLThjZDYtYzA2OWE4YzkwMzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTU3MDc0MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gregory Jbara","asCharacter":"Dan O'Keefeas Dan O'Keefe…"},{"id":"nm0310978","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"J.B.
