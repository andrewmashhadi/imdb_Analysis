His daughter is stealing from him to save up for a nose job, his pot-head son, who gets stoned at his own bar-mitzvah, only wants him round to fix the TV aerial and his useless brother Arthur is an unwelcome house guest. But both Arthur and Larry get turfed out into a motel when Larry's wife Judy, who wants a divorce, moves her lover, Sy, into the house and even after Sy's death in a car crash they are still there. With lawyers' bills mounting for his divorce, Arthur's criminal court appearances and a land feud with a neighbour Larry is tempted to take the bribe offered by a student to give him an illegal exam pass mark. And the rabbis he visits for advice only dole out platitudes. Still God moves in mysterious - and not always pleasant - ways, as Larry and his family will find out.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 2 Oscars, 17 wins & 80 nominations total","directors":"Ethan Coen, Joel Coen","directorList":[{"id":"nm0001053","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"id":"nm0001054","name":"Joel Coen"}],"writers":"Joel Coen, Ethan Coen","writerList":[{"id":"nm0001054","name":"Joel Coen"},{"id":"nm0001053","name":"Ethan Coen"}],"stars":"Michael Stuhlbarg, Richard Kind, Sari Lennick","starList":[{"id":"nm0836121","name":"Michael Stuhlbarg"},{"id":"nm0454236","name":"Richard Kind"},{"id":"nm3102689","name":"Sari Lennick"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0836121","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjdjNTlhZjUtODA0MC00Mjc3LWExNmMtZDc5ZmI0ZmNlZWZmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Stuhlbarg","asCharacter":"Larry Gopnikas Larry Gopnik"},{"id":"nm0454236","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMzgyNTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTQ0OTI4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard Kind","asCharacter":"Uncle Arthuras Uncle Arthur"},{"id":"nm3102689","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZjZhNDkyZGYtODBjMC00NDJiLWE0YjktNDgyYzUyYzQ4NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sari Lennick","asCharacter":"Judith Gopnikas Judith Gopnik"},{"id":"nm0577329","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA1MTM1MTc4MDZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDQ4MjA3ODI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Fred Melamed","asCharacter":"Sy Ablemanas Sy Ableman"},{"id":"nm3129800","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMyNjMwMjI1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk2MjY4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Aaron Wolff","asCharacter":"Danny Gopnikas Danny Gopnik"},{"id":"nm3127056","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jessica McManus","asCharacter":"Sarah Gopnikas Sarah Gopnik"},{"id":"nm0106998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWUzZGQ2YTEtNmQ0NC00MDMyLThlY2QtNmI0NjllYjIyOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjczMTE4Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Peter Breitmayer","asCharacter":"Mr. Brandtas Mr. Brandt"},{"id":"nm3176987","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Brent Braunschweig","asCharacter":"Mitch Brandtas Mitch Brandt"},{"id":"nm3176222","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"David Kang","asCharacter":"Clive Parkas Clive Park"},{"id":"nm3185299","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Benjamin Portnoe","asCharacter":"Danny's Reefer Buddyas Danny's Reefer Buddy"},{"id":"nm3176215","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jack Swiler","asCharacter":"Boy on Busas Boy on Bus"},{"id":"nm3163171","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Andrew S.
