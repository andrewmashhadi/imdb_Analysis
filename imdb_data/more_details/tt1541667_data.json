An experienced veteran, she always gets her man. Autumn, a worried young woman, comes to her with a sinking suspicion about her boyfriend. Strange phone calls, missing for nights on end and a host of other oddball behavior lead Autumn to think he has been going about behind her back. Susan takes the case, businesslike as always. She tails the boyfriend by day, and by night. She sees where he shops, who he spends time with. She dislikes him more with each passing hour. After endless days of surveillance and nights away from her own husband, she finally figures out what needs to be done. Susan can't possibly comprehend the events this seemingly simple case will have set into motion in Autumn's life, and her very own.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Michael Romano","directorList":[{"id":"nm2794620","name":"Michael Romano"}],"writers":"Michael Romano","writerList":[{"id":"nm2794620","name":"Michael Romano"}],"stars":"Susan Wyshynski, Alexandra Tabas, Nick Masciangelo","starList":[{"id":"nm2670177","name":"Susan Wyshynski"},{"id":"nm3364080","name":"Alexandra Tabas"},{"id":"nm3374521","name":"Nick Masciangelo"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm2670177","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Susan Wyshynski","asCharacter":"Susan Pierceas Susan Pierce"},{"id":"nm3364080","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ1NmZhYWMtMjFiYy00MjVlLTlkOGUtMzczOGJhMTNhNDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjA0MjM5Mzc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alexandra Tabas","asCharacter":"Autumnas Autumn"},{"id":"nm3374521","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWE1NGVmMzAtNGI3MC00M2I2LWJlNjYtZWYwMjkwYWU1MGJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nick Masciangelo","asCharacter":"Freddieas Freddie"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Short, Drama","genreList":[{"key":"Short","value":"Short"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"}],"companies":"","companyList":[],"countries":"USA","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"}],"languages":"English","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"}],"contentRating":null,"imDbRating":null,"imDbRatingVotes":null,"metacriticRating":null,"ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$600 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"","grossUSA":"","cumulativeWorldwideGross":""},"tagline":null,"keywords":"","keywordList":[],"similars":[],"tvSeriesInfo":null,"tvEpisodeInfo":null,"errorMessage":null}
