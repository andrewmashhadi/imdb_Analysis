Shortly after Gran leaves for a week, Boy's father Alamein appears out of the blue. Having imagined a heroic version of his father during his absence, Boy comes face-to-face with the real version: an incompetent hoodlum who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years before. This is where the goat enters.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 13 wins & 9 nominations","directors":"Taika Waititi","directorList":[{"id":"nm0169806","name":"Taika
