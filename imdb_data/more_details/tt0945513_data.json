The only catch is can only be there for 8 minutes at any given time. That morning, a bomb exploded on a commuter train just outside Chicago. He occupies the body of teacher going to work on that train and is confused as to what he is doing or why he is there as his last memory is of flying his helicopter on a combat mission in Afghanistan. Those in charge of the program explain to him that there is a bomb on the train, and that he must locate it. More importantly, he must identify the bomber as another bombing is expected later that day. He is also told however that he cannot change the past and can only gather information. As he develops a liking for his traveling companion Christina, he sets out to test that theory.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 win & 8 nominations","directors":"Duncan Jones","directorList":[{"id":"nm1512910","name":"Duncan Jones"}],"writers":"Ben Ripley","writerList":[{"id":"nm1618286","name":"Ben Ripley"}],"stars":"Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Monaghan, Vera Farmiga","starList":[{"id":"nm0350453","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"id":"nm1157358","name":"Michelle Monaghan"},{"id":"nm0267812","name":"Vera Farmiga"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0350453","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjA0MTU2NDY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4ODkzMzE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","asCharacter":"Colter Stevensas Colter Stevens"},{"id":"nm1157358","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzEwYTdjNjYtZDk4NC00YzFmLTlkZTQtNTQyZTg3YmIxYWIxL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5MzIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michelle Monaghan","asCharacter":"Christina Warrenas Christina Warren"},{"id":"nm0267812","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjIwNTU3NDUyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwODg5NDE@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Vera Farmiga","asCharacter":"Colleen Goodwinas Colleen Goodwin"},{"id":"nm0942482","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI1NDYyNzk4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAyMzI1MDI@._V1_Ratio1.5000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jeffrey Wright","asCharacter":"Dr. Rutledgeas Dr. Rutledge"},{"id":"nm2260797","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjEwMTE3OTU1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzIyNTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Michael Arden","asCharacter":"Derek Frostas Derek Frost"},{"id":"nm0031679","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYzY2YzgyYmMtYmI0MC00ODYyLWJkZjAtMjYzMGU2OGYyN2YwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMwMzMyMg@@._V1_Ratio1.2143_AL_.jpg","name":"Cas Anvar","asCharacter":"Hazmias Hazmi"},{"id":"nm0992289","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI4MzkzMDY4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU4NjIzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Russell Peters","asCharacter":"Max Denoffas Max Denoff"},{"id":"nm2287876","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlmZmQ4MTUtNThmZC00NzJhLTk1ZjMtMjZjM2ZmZDA2NDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brent Skagford","asCharacter":"George Troxelas George Troxel"},{"id":"nm0858656","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2JjNGE0MTctMWNhZi00OGMzLThlNTItYjNjODM4ZjUxZmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjg4Mjg3Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Craig Thomas","asCharacter":"Gold Watch Executiveas Gold Watch Executive"},{"id":"nm0557619","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODE3MDI3NDA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM0MTkyMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Gordon Masten","asCharacter":"Conductoras Conductor"},{"id":"nm0047734","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Susan Bain","asCharacter":"Nurseas Nurse"},{"id":"nm0387030","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmJjMjQzMzAtYWM5ZS00NTMyLTg4OTctOGM3MGU5NjE2N2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzIyODQ4MA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paula Jean Hixson","asCharacter":"Coffee Mug Ladyas Coffee Mug Lady"},{"id":"nm0911689","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Lincoln Ward","asCharacter":"Minister Sudokuas Minister Sudoku"},{"id":"nm2497549","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI4Nzk5MDI5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg1ODkzMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kyle Gatehouse","asCharacter":"College Studentas College Student"},{"id":"nm1429920","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjExMTkwMjI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM4NjM0MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Albert Kwan","asCharacter":"Soda Can Guyas Soda Can Guy"},{"id":"nm0206635","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzJhOThkZWEtNWYxYi00MDNmLWE3NzEtODg2YzA5MTQzMjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Anne Day-Jones","asCharacter":"Office Manageras Office Manager"},{"id":"nm1983018","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Clarice Byrne","asCharacter":"Secretaryas Secretary"},{"id":"nm1123994","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc2NjQ3NDA0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTExMTIxMTE@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"James A.
