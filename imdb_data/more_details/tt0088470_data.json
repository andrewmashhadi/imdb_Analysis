Marla Gibbs, who first shot to stardom for playing Florence Johnston, the sarcastic housekeeper to Louise and George Jefferson on The Jeffersons (1975), got her own series. Gibbs starred as tart-tongued Mary Jenkins. Her husband Lester (Hal Williams) was a construction worker and they had a teenage daughter, Brenda (Regina King). Pearl Shay (Helen Martin) was an annoying but open-minded neighbor who gossiped with Mary, and Rose Lee Holloway (Alaina Reed-Hall) was Mary's best friend, who lived in the building with her daughter Tiffany (Kia Goodwin) and was sympathetic to the neighbors. The landlord died in the pilot episode and Rose took his place until season four. Attractive, sassy vamp Sandra Clark (Jackée Harry) showed up later in the show's run.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy, 2 wins & 7 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Helen Martin, Marla Gibbs, Hal Williams","starList":[{"id":"nm0552385","name":"Helen Martin"},{"id":"nm0004958","name":"Marla Gibbs"},{"id":"nm0930724","name":"Hal Williams"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0552385","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM5NTE3NzYyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDgzNDQyNA@@._V1_Ratio1.1429_AL_.jpg","name":"Helen Martin","asCharacter":"Pearl Shayas Pearl Shay"},{"id":"nm0004958","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjg3NTYzMzQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjg5NDQwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marla Gibbs","asCharacter":"Mary Jenkinsas Mary Jenkins"},{"id":"nm0930724","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzExNDgwNTYxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDM5NTQ4._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hal Williams","asCharacter":"Lester Jenkinsas Lester Jenkins"},{"id":"nm0355271","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2NDkxODQwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM4NTAxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Alaina Reed-Hall","asCharacter":"Rose Lee Hollowayas Rose Lee Holloway"},{"id":"nm0005093","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGM1M2I1ZWQtNWVmMC00YTE4LWFiNDEtNWVlN2FmNmU5MjZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Regina King","asCharacter":"Brenda Jenkinsas Brenda Jenkins"},{"id":"nm0049880","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzI4Njg5NTctOGNhOS00NzYxLTkyYmQtM2ViN2M1ZGQyZGViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM3MDMyMDQ@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Curtis Baldwin","asCharacter":"Calvin Dobbsas Calvin Dobbs"},{"id":"nm0364068","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTUxMzIwNjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzUyOTg0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jackée Harry","asCharacter":"Sandra Clarkas Sandra Clark"},{"id":"nm0811746","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk2NDkyMTc4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU2NjkxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Barry Sobel","asCharacter":"Dylan McMillanas Dylan McMillan"},{"id":"nm0934902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTI3MDUxMjk1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTUwNDM2._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Winfield","asCharacter":"Julian C.
