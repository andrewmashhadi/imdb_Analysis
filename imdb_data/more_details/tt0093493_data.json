But everything changes when he builds a mannequin, which he falls in love with. It is the first thing he has made that makes him feel like a real artist. Much to his surprise, Jonathan discovers the mannequin prominently displayed in the window of Prince and Company department store. When he saves the life of an old lady who happens to be the owner of that store, he is rewarded by getting a job at the store as a stock boy. The mannequin later comes to life as Ema \"Emmy\" Hesire, who was an ancient Egyptian princess living in the year 2514 BC. Gorgeous and vivacious, this femme fatale helps Jonathan turn his career around, inspiring him to become the best window dresser in town. But Emmy soon discovers that the real world is not very dear, when they run into competitors who want to bring them out of business - for good.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 5 wins & 4 nominations total","directors":"Michael Gottlieb","directorList":[{"id":"nm0331998","name":"Michael Gottlieb"}],"writers":"Edward Rugoff, Michael Gottlieb","writerList":[{"id":"nm0749493","name":"Edward Rugoff"},{"id":"nm0331998","name":"Michael Gottlieb"}],"stars":"Andrew McCarthy, Kim Cattrall, Estelle Getty","starList":[{"id":"nm0000530","name":"Andrew McCarthy"},{"id":"nm0000326","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"id":"nm0001268","name":"Estelle Getty"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000530","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE5NzU0MzY0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTE2MDkzODE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andrew McCarthy","asCharacter":"Jonathan Switcheras Jonathan Switcher"},{"id":"nm0000326","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU4NjMyMjAyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1ODQ5MQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kim Cattrall","asCharacter":"Emmyas Emmy"},{"id":"nm0001268","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY3NTkwODI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjQzNDg5Nw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Estelle Getty","asCharacter":"Claire Timkinas Claire Timkin"},{"id":"nm0000652","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3MTQ5NjY5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY0NzU5MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Spader","asCharacter":"Richardsas Richards"},{"id":"nm0047265","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY4MDMzNzU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTY2MDc1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"G.W.
