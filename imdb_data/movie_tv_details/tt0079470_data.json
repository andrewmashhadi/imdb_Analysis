Brian joins a political resistance movement aiming to get the Romans out of Judea. Brian scores a victory of sorts when he manages to paint political slogans on an entire wall in the city of Jerusalem. The movement is not very effective but somehow Brian becomes a prophet and gathers his own following. His fate is sealed however and he lives a very short life.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated movie #239 | See the Top 250 movies as rated by IMDb users","directors":"Terry
