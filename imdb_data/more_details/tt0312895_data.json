But these qualities only earn Detective Constable \"Dangerous\" Davies the scorn of his fellow detectives in a small London police station. His boss tells him straight out that he's the last detective he would assign to a major crime-solving mission. Unlucky in love, rumpled, and accident-prone, Dangerous muddles on and, with help from his eccentric friend Mod, he proves the merits of his dogged, unglamorous method. He likes being a detective, and occasionally he gets to do some good.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Peter
