Meanwhile, the teenagers scouts Ben Goudy and Carter Grant decide to camp for the last time since they are too old to be scouts. The problem is that they do not want to harm the feelings of their friend Augie Foster and the Scout Leader Rogers. They have a flat tire after hitting a deer on the road and Carter's sister Kendall Grant, her boyfriend and her friend Chloe stop their Jeep to see whether they need a ride. They invite Ben and Carter to go to a party in the night. The two scouts leave the camping during the night to go to the party. When they drive through the town, they do not see a living soul and they decide to visit a night-club since the bouncer is not at the door. They discover that people have turned into zombies and they team-up with Ben's recent acquaintance Denise Russo, who is bartender in the nightclub, and Augie that was left alone at the camp and came to the town. Soon they discover that the non-infected inhabitants have been evacuated and the town will be bombed by the government. They decide to rescue Kendall but they find that the address her boyfriend gave to them is wrong. What can they do to save Kendall?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 nominations","directors":"Christopher Landon","directorList":[{"id":"nm0484907","name":"Christopher Landon"}],"writers":"Carrie Lee Wilson, Emi Mochizuki, Christopher Landon","writerList":[{"id":"nm0933144","name":"Carrie Lee Wilson"},{"id":"nm0595088","name":"Emi Mochizuki"},{"id":"nm0484907","name":"Christopher Landon"}],"stars":"Tye Sheridan, Logan Miller, Joey Morgan","starList":[{"id":"nm4446467","name":"Tye Sheridan"},{"id":"nm2383250","name":"Logan Miller"},{"id":"nm6368720","name":"Joey Morgan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm4446467","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTJjODlmNjAtNjE3Ny00NzIwLTkwMjItOWY1MzM4ZDM1ZTM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzczNzg0ODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tye Sheridan","asCharacter":"Ben Goudyas Ben Goudy"},{"id":"nm2383250","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYWRlMjkyM2QtYTQzNC00NmJkLTkzMWQtZTI5MzNkYzI2MWY4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQwMDQwNjY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Logan Miller","asCharacter":"Carter Grantas Carter Grant"},{"id":"nm6368720","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyMzY2MzA2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzg3NTk0ODE@._V1_Ratio2.3286_AL_.jpg","name":"Joey Morgan","asCharacter":"Augie Fosteras Augie Foster"},{"id":"nm3924288","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwNTg4MTMwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY2MTkzMDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sarah Dumont","asCharacter":"Denise Russoas Denise Russo"},{"id":"nm0462712","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcwODM1MjExNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzY2ODg2MDE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Koechner","asCharacter":"Scout Leader Rogersas Scout Leader Rogers"},{"id":"nm4296013","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDQzMWU0MTMtNTNjNC00YjUyLTlhMjctZjEwMGQ0YzRlNDRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Halston Sage","asCharacter":"Kendall Grantas Kendall Grant"},{"id":"nm0001458","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTEwNTM4NjI4NzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDkxMTg0NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Cloris Leachman","asCharacter":"Miss Fielderas Miss Fielder"},{"id":"nm1411829","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTlhMjI4M2ItN2M0ZS00YjcyLWEwMmUtMGVmZmM2ZGJjOGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzUyMjgwMzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Niki Koss","asCharacter":"Chloeas Chloe"},{"id":"nm4876129","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTA5Y2FjMjgtOTkzMC00MDRmLThlMzgtZTRlMWYyOWFjYTdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjY4MzQ3NTg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Hiram A.
