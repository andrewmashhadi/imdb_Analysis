The peace and tranquility he hopes to find, though, is anything but, once he agrees to being accompanied by the only person he can find willing to join him on the trek - his long-lost and former friend Stephen Katz (Nick Nolte), a down-on-his-luck serial philanderer who, after a lifetime of relying on his charm and wits to keep one step ahead of the law - sees the trip as a way to sneak out of paying some debts and sneak into one last adventure before its too late. The trouble is, the two have a completely different definition of the word, \"adventure\". Now they're about to find out that when you push yourself to the edge, the real fun begins.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"Ken Kwapis","directorList":[{"id":"nm0477129","name":"Ken Kwapis"}],"writers":"Michael Arndt, Bill Holderman, Bill Bryson","writerList":[{"id":"nm1578335","name":"Michael Arndt"},{"id":"nm2250139","name":"Bill Holderman"},{"id":"nm0117445","name":"Bill Bryson"}],"stars":"Robert Redford, Nick Nolte, Emma Thompson","starList":[{"id":"nm0000602","name":"Robert Redford"},{"id":"nm0000560","name":"Nick Nolte"},{"id":"nm0000668","name":"Emma Thompson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000602","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1Nzc5MzQyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ5OTA0Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Robert Redford","asCharacter":"Bill Brysonas Bill Bryson"},{"id":"nm0000560","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU1ODAzMDk3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTEzMzE0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nick Nolte","asCharacter":"Stephen Katzas Stephen Katz"},{"id":"nm0000668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMwNTAyOTg0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTg0MzY1Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Emma Thompson","asCharacter":"Catherine Brysonas Catherine Bryson"},{"id":"nm0005460","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk1OTI5OTc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc5NDMwNA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Steenburgen","asCharacter":"Jeannieas Jeannie"},{"id":"nm0644406","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTYzMjY2ODkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQxMDA5MTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Nick Offerman","asCharacter":"REI Daveas REI Dave"},{"id":"nm1102891","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg0NTQ1NzY1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NjIxMDI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kristen Schaal","asCharacter":"Mary Ellenas Mary Ellen"},{"id":"nm0364931","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGUxNjkyMzItNGZhNi00NmFhLWI3MzItYTI3M2MyNmViYmU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzQ2OTUzOA@@._V1_Ratio1.2429_AL_.jpg","name":"R.
