First-time parents Greg and Kim Warner struggle daily to become perfect at the job. Kim is a neurotic stay-at-home mother, and although her husband Greg is a success in his career, his more-difficult job is keeping his wife calm as they raise their year-old son Sam. While Kim is determined to be the perfect mother and perfect wife and to raise the perfect son, her sister, Christine Hughes, a very down-to-earth mother of four-year-old Dominic and one-year-old Logan, continually reminds her that life will never be perfect. Christine's husband Jimmy is employed as a security guard and unconcerned about living in Kim and Greg's guest house and feels compelled to share with his brother-in-law his philosophy about being a husband and father while still remaining a man.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Primetime Emmy, 3 wins & 4 nominations
