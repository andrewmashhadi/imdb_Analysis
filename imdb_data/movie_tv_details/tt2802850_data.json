Helping him piece things together is his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson. The investigation will lead them to a colorful cast of characters that includes Karl Weathers, the town lawyer of Luverne, Minnesota. A Korean War vet, Karl is a flowery drunk blessed with the gift of gab and the eloquence of a true con artist. Joe Bulo, the front man for the northern expansion of a Kansas City crime syndicate. The new face of corporate crime, Joe's bringing a Walmart mentality to small town America. His number two is Mike Milligan. Part enforcer, part detective, Mike is always smiling - but the joke is usually on you. Bulo and his crew have their sights set on the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, currently led by matriarch Floyd Gerhardt. With her husband at death's door, Floyd takes over the family business, frustrating her eldest son, Dodd Gerhardt. An impatient hothead with a cruel streak to match his ambitions, Dodd can't wait for both his parents to die so he can take over and expand their business from kingdom to empire. Bear Gerhardt is the middle son, an intimidatingly large man who, although inarticulate, is the most decent of his clan. Rye Gerhardt, the youngest of the Gerhardt clan, views himself as a big shot, but in reality he's just a small dog who barks big.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Top rated TV #39 | Won 6 Primetime Emmys, 60 wins & 247 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman, Allison Tolman","starList":[{"id":"nm0000671","name":"Billy Bob Thornton"},{"id":"nm0293509","name":"Martin Freeman"},{"id":"nm2798112","name":"Allison Tolman"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000671","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcxOTUwMDI0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjIyNzkzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Billy Bob Thornton","asCharacter":"Lorne Malvoas Lorne Malvo…"},{"id":"nm0293509","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE0MjAwOTMzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDg1MjEyNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Martin Freeman","asCharacter":"Lester Nygaardas Lester Nygaard…"},{"id":"nm2798112","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzA4ZDg3NzktNjFlNy00ZjZlLTg5OTMtYzVmN2U4NmRhNjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkyNjMwNzc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Allison Tolman","asCharacter":"Molly Solversonas Molly Solverson"},{"id":"nm0004988","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTc5OTcxNjIzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI0NjMyMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Colin Hanks","asCharacter":"Gus Grimlyas Gus Grimly"},{"id":"nm2341751","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0NDM1Nzc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQ2NDQxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Russell Harvard","asCharacter":"Mr. Wrenchas Mr. Wrench"},{"id":"nm0940158","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODY0MjQ0MDQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgxNzQxNjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bokeem Woodbine","asCharacter":"Mike Milliganas Mike Milligan"},{"id":"nm0542668","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmI3ODNmYTEtNjU1ZS00M2NlLThjZTQtYzY2ZjI1ZDdhYjQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzEzMTI0MjI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brad Mann","asCharacter":"Gale Kitchenas Gale Kitchen"},{"id":"nm0000379","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQ3NzkwNzM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzE2MTQ3MjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kirsten Dunst","asCharacter":"Peggy Blumquistas Peggy Blumquist"},{"id":"nm0000191","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1MjQ0MDg0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyNjI5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ewan McGregor","asCharacter":"Emmit Stussyas Emmit Stussy…"},{"id":"nm0001674","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTEyNjM5MjgyNzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU3MDAzMzUyODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Chris Rock","asCharacter":"Loy Cannonas Loy Cannon"},{"id":"nm0933940","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTkzNzcxNzcxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM1ODUzMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Patrick Wilson","asCharacter":"Lou Solversonas Lou Solverson"},{"id":"nm4689420","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2JlNjA2MzgtNjMwNy00Mjg1LTk1NGYtZTQ3NTZjYTgxMjM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Carrie Coon","asCharacter":"Gloria Burgleas Gloria Burgle"},{"id":"nm2976580","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNjlmMmQ2MzktMzY3Zi00ZWRiLThiOTAtNDMyYWY2YTBmYzU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODk4OTc3MTY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jessie Buckley","asCharacter":"Oraetta Mayfloweras Oraetta Mayflower"},{"id":"nm0687146","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZTQyMzQzMjEtODVjMS00YzEzLWJjNzItY2I0MWM1YjY3MjZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxNjMxMjE5._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jesse Plemons","asCharacter":"Ed Blumquistas Ed Blumquist"},{"id":"nm0935541","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMGNhZDVjM2MtMGQ2Mi00ZjRmLWJkZDUtYmMzOWZjMWFmNGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","asCharacter":"Nikki Swangoas Nikki Swango"},{"id":"nm0005403","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyNjY0NTgzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ0ODk2Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jason Schwartzman","asCharacter":"Josto Faddaas Josto Fadda"},{"id":"nm0000667","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTA3MjM4NTE0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTU1OTY4NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David Thewlis","asCharacter":"V.M.
