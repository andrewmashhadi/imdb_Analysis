Like its earlier novel and big-screen brethren, \"Mr. Belvedere\" featured British butler Lynn Belvedere, who takes a job as a live-in nanny for a typical American family and records their everyday experiences in his diary for future use in writing a novel. In the 1985 small-screen version, the Owens family served as that \"typical American family\" and the source of fodder for Belvedere, who had previously worked as a gentry for Winston Churchill and had connections to British royalty. Family patriarch George (played by sportscaster Bob Uecker) was, in an example of art imitating life, a sportswriter; the matriarch was Marsha, a law student. The couple, who had settled in suburban Pittsburgh, had three children: awkward teenager Kevin; precocious, easily-embarrassed Heather; and mischievous prankster Wesley. George was initially uncomfortable hiring the worldly Belvedere but eventually came to appreciate the Englishman's friendship (as well as his expert culinary skills). Unlike his older siblings, Wesley never seemed to get along with Belvedere, but even he came to appreciate the British native's regularly-dispensed advice. Each episode ended with Belvedere writing in his journal, giving the show's moral while putting everything into perspective. In later years, Marsha graduated from law school and got her first job, and Kevin and Heather graduated from high school and entered college. The 1985 small-screen adaptation of \"Mr. Belvedere\" marked the end of a long succession of unsuccessful attempts to bring Davenport's novel to television; the three earlier pilots were made in the 1950s (soon after the final big-screen movie) and 1960s.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 1 Primetime Emmy, 2 wins & 12 nominations total","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Christopher Hewett, Bob Uecker, Ilene Graff","starList":[{"id":"nm0381973","name":"Christopher Hewett"},{"id":"nm0879902","name":"Bob Uecker"},{"id":"nm0333778","name":"Ilene Graff"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0381973","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg4MTE5NDEzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjY2OTky._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Christopher Hewett","asCharacter":"Mr. Lynn Aloysius Belvedereas Mr. Lynn Aloysius Belvedere"},{"id":"nm0879902","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM2OTgzMzI1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTkyMzAyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Uecker","asCharacter":"George Owensas George Owens"},{"id":"nm0333778","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTMxNDI5NDQ3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTA3MzMzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ilene Graff","asCharacter":"Marsha Cameron Owensas Marsha Cameron Owens"},{"id":"nm0832130","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZDVmOTZiN2ItZGI5MS00YmEwLWJhNGQtN2MxMWM5MDk3NjczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjEzNDI5ODg@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rob Stone","asCharacter":"Kevin Owensas Kevin Owens"},{"id":"nm0920455","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA3NTI0NjY0NDdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDcxODE4OTQz._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Tracy Wells","asCharacter":"Heather Owensas Heather Owens"},{"id":"nm0065740","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTViYzdiZjEtZDhjNy00ZmQyLWIyNzEtMTM0NjgyN2M0ZWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzMwMzczMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brice Beckham","asCharacter":"Wesley T.
