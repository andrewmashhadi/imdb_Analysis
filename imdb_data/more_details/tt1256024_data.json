After she borrows money from Sheldon, who freely offered it to her, and after Leonard allows her to forgo paying for her share of their group meals, Penny begins to get agitated whenever the issue of money in whatever form is discussed. Since she is obviously stressed about her financial situation, Leonard looks over her finances, and sees one financial outlay which is a cause of most of the problem. Although he could get physically hurt by this action, Leonard decides to help Penny get this money back which is rightfully hers.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"Mark Cendrowski","directorList":[{"id":"nm0148252","name":"Mark Cendrowski"}],"writers":"Chuck Lorre, Bill Prady, Richard Rosenstock","writerList":[{"id":"nm0521143","name":"Chuck Lorre"},{"id":"nm0695080","name":"Bill Prady"},{"id":"nm0742711","name":"Richard Rosenstock"}],"stars":"Johnny Galecki, Jim Parsons, Kaley Cuoco","starList":[{"id":"nm0301959","name":"Johnny Galecki"},{"id":"nm1433588","name":"Jim Parsons"},{"id":"nm0192505","name":"Kaley Cuoco"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0301959","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzQ2ODY0MTIwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDQ2NzMzMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Johnny Galecki","asCharacter":"Leonard Hofstadteras Leonard Hofstadter"},{"id":"nm1433588","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg1MTkxODgzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjExMjgyNzM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Jim Parsons","asCharacter":"Sheldon Cooperas Sheldon Cooper"},{"id":"nm0192505","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjYyYmNlZTMtM2RlZC00YTlhLTk5YzItZTQ4OTA3Y2FkNzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTAzMjY1OTY@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kaley Cuoco","asCharacter":"Pennyas Penny"},{"id":"nm0374865","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMzk4ZWFlY2EtZmY3Ny00MGM0LWFiNTgtZDg4YmQ5YTIzZTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODY3NzcwMTE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Simon Helberg","asCharacter":"Howard Wolowitzas Howard Wolowitz"},{"id":"nm2471798","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTQzMzQyMTYyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjYyMDI5Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kunal Nayyar","asCharacter":"Raj Koothrappalias Raj Koothrappali"},{"id":"nm1341438","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjA2NDc3OTM3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTg2NzkzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Brian Patrick Wade","asCharacter":"Kurtas Kurt"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Comedy, Romance","genreList":[{"key":"Comedy","value":"Comedy"},{"key":"Romance","value":"Romance"}],"companies":"Chuck Lorre Productions, Warner Bros.
