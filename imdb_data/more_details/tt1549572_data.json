On the same night, a planet similar and close to Earth is discovered and called Earth 2. Rhoda drives her car looking at Earth 2 and crashes with composer John Burroughs, killing his pregnant wife and his baby son. Rhoda goes to prison and four years later she is released and moves to her parents' house. She finds a job as high-school janitor, but tries to commit suicide. She survives, however, and submits an essay to a contest where the prize is a ticket to travel to Earth 2. Meanwhile the scientists discover that Earth 2 is a mirror of Earth and the synchronicity between the dwellers was interrupted when the planets were seen by each other. One day, Rhoda decides to visit John Burroughs, whose life was destroyed after the death of his family, to admit to him that she had killed his family. However she does not have the nerve to tell him the truth. So she lies and tells him he has won a free cleaning service of his home. Rhoda wins the writing contest, but meanwhile John and she have fallen in love with each other. Rhoda has to take a decision whether she goes or stays, but she wants to tell John the truth first.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 7 wins & 14 nominations","directors":"Mike Cahill","directorList":[{"id":"nm2648685","name":"Mike Cahill"}],"writers":"Mike Cahill, Brit Marling","writerList":[{"id":"nm2648685","name":"Mike Cahill"},{"id":"nm1779870","name":"Brit Marling"}],"stars":"Brit Marling, William Mapother, Matthew-Lee Erlbach","starList":[{"id":"nm1779870","name":"Brit Marling"},{"id":"nm0544611","name":"William Mapother"},{"id":"nm3211972","name":"Matthew-Lee Erlbach"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1779870","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTcxOTMxOTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODcwMjg1MjE@._V1_Ratio1.4571_AL_.jpg","name":"Brit Marling","asCharacter":"Rhoda Williamsas Rhoda Williams"},{"id":"nm0544611","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAyNzkyMTgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI1MTkzNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.2571_AL_.jpg","name":"William Mapother","asCharacter":"John Burroughsas John Burroughs"},{"id":"nm3211972","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZGZiNGZlMWEtYjk1Mi00OGE1LTkxN2ItNjBhZWE2NDhiNGRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.3857_AL_.jpg","name":"Matthew-Lee Erlbach","asCharacter":"Alexas Alex"},{"id":"nm4544251","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"DJ Flava","asCharacter":"DJ Flavaas DJ Flava"},{"id":"nm2311470","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Meggan Lennon","asCharacter":"Maya Burroughsas Maya Burroughs"},{"id":"nm4543466","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"AJ Diana","asCharacter":"Amos Burroughsas Amos Burroughs"},{"id":"nm4252111","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTY4MzAyMjg4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzA0MDAwMjE@._V1_Ratio1.6000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bruce Colbert","asCharacter":"Symposium Speakeras Symposium Speaker"},{"id":"nm0583796","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTA4MzY4MzI4MTdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU2MDU0MjI5NQ@@._V1_Ratio1.4143_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Mezey","asCharacter":"Symposium Speakeras Symposium Speaker"},{"id":"nm3170260","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ana Valle","asCharacter":"Symposium Speakeras Symposium Speaker"},{"id":"nm0325528","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Jeffrey Goldenberg","asCharacter":"Symposium Speakeras Symposium Speaker"},{"id":"nm3261998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Joseph A.
