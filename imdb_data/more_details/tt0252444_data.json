Government policy includes taking half-white, half-Aboriginal children from their Aboriginal mothers and sending them a thousand miles away to what amounts to indentured servitude, \"to save them from themselves.\" Molly, Daisy, and Grace (two sisters and a cousin who are fourteen, ten, and eight) arrive at their Gulag and promptly escape, under Molly's lead. For several days they walk north, following a fence that keeps rabbits from settlements, eluding a native tracker and the regional constabulary. Their pursuers take orders from the government's \"Chief Protector of Aborigines\", A.O. Neville, blinded by Anglo-Christian certainty, evolutionary world view, and conventional wisdom. Can the girls survive?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 23 wins & 25 nominations","directors":"Phillip Noyce","directorList":[{"id":"nm0637518","name":"Phillip Noyce"}],"writers":"Doris Pilkington, Christine Olsen","writerList":[{"id":"nm0969922","name":"Doris Pilkington"},{"id":"nm0647608","name":"Christine Olsen"}],"stars":"Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, Kenneth Branagh","starList":[{"id":"nm1082266","name":"Everlyn Sampi"},{"id":"nm1082270","name":"Tianna Sansbury"},{"id":"nm0000110","name":"Kenneth Branagh"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm1082266","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY2NjI2OTE2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTU0MTQ3._V1_Ratio1.4286_AL_.jpg","name":"Everlyn Sampi","asCharacter":"Molly Craigas Molly Craig"},{"id":"nm1082270","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE4NTE1NTc0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTI0MTQ3._V1_Ratio1.5286_AL_.jpg","name":"Tianna Sansbury","asCharacter":"Daisy Craig Kadibillas Daisy Craig Kadibill"},{"id":"nm0000110","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI0NTQ4Mjk5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDc1NjkzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Kenneth Branagh","asCharacter":"A.O.
