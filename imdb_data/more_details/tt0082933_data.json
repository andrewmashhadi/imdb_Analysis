Upon his return home, he learns from her that she wants a divorce. They both go through a series of different emotions related to their situation, Mark's which is generally obsessive about learning why Anna, who he still loves, wants the divorce, and Anna's which is generally increasingly histrionic in getting away from Mark. Caught in the middle is their infant son Bob, who Mark uses as a gage to Anna's mental state. Anna states that her want for the divorce is not because of another man, but Mark finds out that Anna has a lover named Heinrich. In the meantime, Mark also meets Bob's teacher Helen, who looks exactly like Anna, but is her polar opposite in temperament. Starting a relationship with Helen lessens his obsession with Anna. But as Mark and Anna's encounters together reach more emotional and violent levels, Mark, with help of a private investigative firm, learns that Anna's love life is not all that it appears. Anna's true obsession has a somewhat gruesome process and nothing will stop her from reaching her end goal.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 5 wins & 4 nominations","directors":"Andrzej Zulawski","directorList":[{"id":"nm0958558","name":"Andrzej Zulawski"}],"writers":"Andrzej Zulawski, Frederic Tuten","writerList":[{"id":"nm0958558","name":"Andrzej Zulawski"},{"id":"nm0878292","name":"Frederic Tuten"}],"stars":"Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Margit Carstensen","starList":[{"id":"nm0000254","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"id":"nm0000554","name":"Sam Neill"},{"id":"nm0141380","name":"Margit Carstensen"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000254","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjExMTEyNDUxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU3MDQyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Isabelle Adjani","asCharacter":"Annaas Anna…"},{"id":"nm0000554","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjUyMTU0MzA0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA4MTQ4NjM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Neill","asCharacter":"Markas Mark"},{"id":"nm0141380","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgzMDYyMjk2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAzMDcxMzE@._V1_Ratio1.4000_AL_.jpg","name":"Margit Carstensen","asCharacter":"Margit Gluckmeisteras Margit Gluckmeister"},{"id":"nm0071502","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjViNTM3OTUtZmUwMS00NjM3LTgwMmMtMGMwNmY5MTlhNWM2L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_Ratio1.0286_AL_.jpg","name":"Heinz Bennent","asCharacter":"Heinrichas Heinrich"},{"id":"nm0388682","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Johanna Hofer","asCharacter":"Heinrich's Motheras Heinrich's Mother"},{"id":"nm0240268","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOWI0ZTY5OWItZDE2OS00NzZkLWEwZjQtOTc3YmM0OThlZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.3571_AL_.jpg","name":"Carl Duering","asCharacter":"Detectiveas Detective"},{"id":"nm0493391","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Shaun Lawton","asCharacter":"Zimmermannas Zimmermann"},{"id":"nm0389660","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Michael Hogben","asCharacter":"Bobas Bob"},{"id":"nm0754144","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Maximilian Rüthlein","asCharacter":"Man with Pink Socksas Man with Pink Socks"},{"id":"nm0294633","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Thomas Frey","asCharacter":"Pink Sock's Acolyteas Pink Sock's Acolyte"},{"id":"nm0540804","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Leslie Malton","asCharacter":"Saraas Sara…"},{"id":"nm0626824","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Gerd Neubert","asCharacter":"Subway Drunkas Subway Drunk"},{"id":"nm0937421","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Kerstin Wohlfahrt","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0046984","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ilse Bahrs","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0612598","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Karin Mumm","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0161576","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Herbert Chwoika","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0822106","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Barbara Stanek","asCharacter":""},{"id":"nm0871226","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ilse Trautschold","asCharacter":""}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Drama, Horror","genreList":[{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"Horror","value":"Horror"}],"companies":"Gaumont, Oliane Productions, Marianne Productions","companyList":[{"id":"co0172053","name":"Gaumont"},{"id":"co0026520","name":"Oliane Productions"},{"id":"co0012478","name":"Marianne Productions"}],"countries":"France, West Germany","countryList":[{"key":"France","value":"France"},{"key":"West Germany","value":"West Germany"}],"languages":"English, French, German","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"German","value":"German"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"7.3","imDbRatingVotes":"30883","metacriticRating":"75","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"","openingWeekendUSA":"$24,232","grossUSA":"$1,158,473","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$1,158,473"},"tagline":"...You'll Never Go Out Alone at Night Again.
