On the day before, with great care, he has arranged an interview in a caf√© with an Islamic fundamentalist cleric. When Danny doesn't return, Mariane initiates a search. Pakistani police, American embassy personnel, and the FBI examine witnesses, phone records, e-mails, and hard drives. Who has him? Where is he? There's also the why: because of U.S. abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo, because of a history of Journal cooperation with the CIA, because Pearl is a Jew? Through it all, Mariane is clearheaded, direct, and determined.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 4 wins & 19 nominations","directors":"Michael Winterbottom","directorList":[{"id":"nm0935863","name":"Michael Winterbottom"}],"writers":"John Orloff, Mariane Pearl","writerList":[{"id":"nm0650089","name":"John Orloff"},{"id":"nm1490413","name":"Mariane Pearl"}],"stars":"Angelina Jolie, Dan Futterman, Irrfan Khan","starList":[{"id":"nm0001401","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"id":"nm0001246","name":"Dan Futterman"},{"id":"nm0451234","name":"Irrfan Khan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0001401","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BODg3MzYwMjE4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU5NzAzNw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Angelina Jolie","asCharacter":"Marianeas Mariane"},{"id":"nm0001246","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTgwODA1NjY0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwODExNDQ0._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Dan Futterman","asCharacter":"Dannyas Danny"},{"id":"nm0451234","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDg3NDgxNzY4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODMxODQzMg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Irrfan Khan","asCharacter":"Captainas Captain"},{"id":"nm0659544","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTE2YzBjYTUtYTFlMS00MGZmLWIxMWEtYzkzODc2ZmMwNGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQwMDg0Ng@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Archie Panjabi","asCharacter":"Asraas Asra"},{"id":"nm2666036","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Mohammed Afzal","asCharacter":"Shabbiras Shabbir"},{"id":"nm0451272","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYmFmZTQ4MjgtYmM0YS00ZGNiLTllM2MtNWRiZDlkMDVmMGE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTExNDQ2MTI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Mushtaq Khan","asCharacter":"Danny's Taxi Driveras Danny's Taxi Driver"},{"id":"nm2666003","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Daud Khan","asCharacter":"Masud the Fixeras Masud the Fixer"},{"id":"nm2666009","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Telal Saeed","asCharacter":"Kaleem Yusufas Kaleem Yusuf"},{"id":"nm1268997","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMDFkOTk2YTgtOTM1Ni00MTEwLWE0ZmEtNjdmYzQ1ODMyZTZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQ2MDI5ODE@._V1_Ratio1.7857_AL_.jpg","name":"Arif Khan","asCharacter":"Mariane's Taxi Driveras Mariane's Taxi Driver"},{"id":"nm2666029","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Tipu Taheer","asCharacter":"Human Rights Directoras Human Rights Director"},{"id":"nm1570370","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Amit Dhawan","asCharacter":"Technical Supervisoras Technical Supervisor"},{"id":"nm3039283","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Saira Nasir Khan","asCharacter":"Nasrinas Nasrin"},{"id":"nm2666016","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Aliya Khan","asCharacter":"Kashvaas Kashva"},{"id":"nm2665998","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Sarah Mone","asCharacter":"Female Guestas Female Guest"},{"id":"nm2666010","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Bushra Parwani","asCharacter":"Female Guestas Female Guest"},{"id":"nm1566040","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Zafar Karachiwala","asCharacter":"Male Guestas Male Guest"},{"id":"nm2590742","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Danish Iqbal","asCharacter":"Male Guestas Male Guest"},{"id":"nm2666028","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Ali Tejani","asCharacter":"Male Guestas Male Guest"}],"fullCast":null,"genres":"Biography, Drama, History","genreList":[{"key":"Biography","value":"Biography"},{"key":"Drama","value":"Drama"},{"key":"History","value":"History"}],"companies":"Paramount Vantage, Plan B Entertainment, Revolution Films","companyList":[{"id":"co0179341","name":"Paramount Vantage"},{"id":"co0136967","name":"Plan B Entertainment"},{"id":"co0103733","name":"Revolution Films"}],"countries":"USA, UK","countryList":[{"key":"USA","value":"USA"},{"key":"UK","value":"UK"}],"languages":"English, French, Urdu, Arabic","languageList":[{"key":"English","value":"English"},{"key":"French","value":"French"},{"key":"Urdu","value":"Urdu"},{"key":"Arabic","value":"Arabic"}],"contentRating":"R","imDbRating":"6.6","imDbRatingVotes":"27588","metacriticRating":"74","ratings":null,"wikipedia":null,"posters":null,"images":null,"trailer":null,"boxOffice":{"budget":"$16,000,000 (estimated)","openingWeekendUSA":"$3,948,863","grossUSA":"$9,176,787","cumulativeWorldwideGross":"$19,008,745"},"tagline":"It was an event that shocked the world.
