Because of his childhood, he has always tried to make meaningful emotional connections to other living creatures. That childhood includes not having a male role model with his father having been killed in the war, his overprotective mother smothering him, and an oppressive school system quashing his natural creativity. Being a rock star, he is often wanted more because of what he is than who he is. The most recent failure in that true connection to someone or something else is his marriage, when on tour, he discovers that his wife back home is cheating on him. His response is to go in the opposite direction, by building a figurative wall around him to isolate himself from the rest of the world, but not before showing graphically his feelings on different gut levels. The question becomes if he or anyone else can do anything to tear down the wall in a meaningful way.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Won 2 BAFTA Awards, 3 wins & 2 nominations total","directors":"Alan Parker","directorList":[{"id":"nm0000570","name":"Alan Parker"}],"writers":"Roger Waters","writerList":[{"id":"nm0914166","name":"Roger Waters"}],"stars":"Bob Geldof, Christine Hargreaves, James Laurenson","starList":[{"id":"nm0002097","name":"Bob Geldof"},{"id":"nm0362959","name":"Christine Hargreaves"},{"id":"nm0491190","name":"James Laurenson"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0002097","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzA1MzYwNjM1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTQ1MDc0Mw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Geldof","asCharacter":"Pinkas Pink"},{"id":"nm0362959","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Christine Hargreaves","asCharacter":"Pink's Motheras Pink's Mother"},{"id":"nm0491190","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZmZlM2Y4MjYtZDU1Yy00YjM5LThlNGUtMjVmYmEyZDZjYmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTI3MDk3MzQ@._V1_Ratio1.7571_AL_.jpg","name":"James Laurenson","asCharacter":"J.A.
