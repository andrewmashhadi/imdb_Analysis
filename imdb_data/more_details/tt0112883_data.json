A week before he's supposed to leave, he encounters a young man who attempts suicide--a pretty straightforward case, except that the young man claims to be Don Juan, the fabled Spanish nobleman and world-renowned seducer/lover of women. Despite original hostility from his co-workers, Jack manages to persuade his associates to put the youth in his care for 10 days after which the youth will undergo an evaluation to be either released from psychiatric care or sent to a mental institution. However, as the days progress, Dr. Mickler and the other staff are gradually drawn into the young man's exotic world of love, passion, and pleasure as he tells them the story. While he speaks, the young man's philosophies and zeal for life and love start to revive Dr. Mickler's somewhat-passionless relationship with his wife Marilyn, as well as challenging his own views and ethics to the point where both he and the audience begin to question: could this young man actually be Don Juan?","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar, 4 wins & 5 nominations total","directors":"Jeremy Leven","directorList":[{"id":"nm0505230","name":"Jeremy Leven"}],"writers":"Lord Byron, Jeremy Leven","writerList":[{"id":"nm0126406","name":"Lord Byron"},{"id":"nm0505230","name":"Jeremy Leven"}],"stars":"Johnny Depp, Marlon Brando, Faye Dunaway","starList":[{"id":"nm0000136","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"id":"nm0000008","name":"Marlon Brando"},{"id":"nm0001159","name":"Faye Dunaway"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0000136","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTM0ODU5Nzk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzI2ODgyNQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Johnny Depp","asCharacter":"Don Juan DeMarcoas Don Juan DeMarco"},{"id":"nm0000008","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTg3MDYyMDE5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjgyNTEzNA@@._V1_Ratio1.3000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marlon Brando","asCharacter":"Dr. Jack Mickleras Dr. Jack Mickler"},{"id":"nm0001159","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTk4OTU5MDY0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTc0MTM1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Faye Dunaway","asCharacter":"Marilyn Mickleras Marilyn Mickler"},{"id":"nm0656768","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwNjczMzc4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjU1NzI1OQ@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Géraldine Pailhas","asCharacter":"Doña Anaas Doña Ana"},{"id":"nm0228336","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTY1NzQzMDM4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc3OTgwMw@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Bob Dishy","asCharacter":"Dr. Paul Showalteras Dr. Paul Showalter"},{"id":"nm0001797","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BOTY3MmJjMjgtOGExMS00M2NjLWIzNzMtYmVjNzZlNzExOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA1MzM1NjI1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Rachel Ticotin","asCharacter":"Doña Inezas Doña Inez"},{"id":"nm0000650","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjAwMzU2NTkyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDAxMjQ4Mg@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Talisa Soto","asCharacter":"Doña Juliaas Doña Julia"},{"id":"nm0313882","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjI4OTE2NjMxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEwNDkwOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Marita Geraghty","asCharacter":"Woman in Restaurantas Woman in Restaurant"},{"id":"nm0764781","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BN2E2YjVmYmUtNGIyMC00NWZhLThmYTEtYzY2ZmI5ZGZiZDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard C.
