Scott, whose mother died in childbirth, is Murdoch Lancer's older son. He was raised by his maternal grandfather in Boston. Younger son Johnny was taken from his father by his Mexican mother when he was only around two. He grew up around the Mexican border and went by the name \"Johnny Madrid\", under which he earned a reputation as a fast gun. Deservedly so apparently, as men from his past occasionally showed up to cause problems for Johnny and his newfound family. Teresa O'Brien, daughter of Murdoch's murdered ranch foreman is Murdoch's ward and a surrogate sister to the two boys.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"Awards, 1 nomination","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"James Stacy, Wayne Maunder, Andrew Duggan","starList":[{"id":"nm0821082","name":"James Stacy"},{"id":"nm0560932","name":"Wayne Maunder"},{"id":"nm0240887","name":"Andrew Duggan"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0821082","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTc3NjE0MDc0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc5MDk0MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"James Stacy","asCharacter":"Johnny Madrid Lanceras Johnny Madrid Lancer"},{"id":"nm0560932","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNTIxMzQ1MjA5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMxMzM1MjI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Wayne Maunder","asCharacter":"Scott Lanceras Scott Lancer"},{"id":"nm0240887","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjMyMzAxMDgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI3NDIyOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Andrew Duggan","asCharacter":"Murdoch Lanceras Murdoch Lancer"},{"id":"nm0062420","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BY2RmMzQxMmEtNzllOS00ZmM4LTkzNDMtZjAyYjkxMTJjMGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU5OTg5NDc@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Elizabeth Baur","asCharacter":"Teresa O'Brienas Teresa O'Brien"},{"id":"nm0109495","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU5OTEyOTUwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTczOTEwMjE@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Paul Brinegar","asCharacter":"Jelly Hoskinsas Jelly Hoskins"},{"id":"nm0598489","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Del Monroe","asCharacter":"Driscollas Driscoll…"},{"id":"nm0117252","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BYjQzOTQwMTgtYTJjMy00NzZhLWJjNDYtNDdjNTJjNDFmYzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"William Bryant","asCharacter":"Sheriff Gabeas Sheriff Gabe…"},{"id":"nm1107853","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNmFhYjdkZTMtNTU0YS00YjZiLWFmMzgtY2MyOTE3OTQ0ODBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUxMjc1OTM@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Ray Kellogg","asCharacter":"Bartenderas Bartender…"},{"id":"nm0000833","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjE2MDg4ODA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM5MzkzMQ@@._V1_Ratio1.6286_AL_.jpg","name":"Joe Don Baker","asCharacter":"Clovis Horneras Clovis Horner…"},{"id":"nm0341526","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNDQ0NjEyNzI4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDUyNTAxOA@@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"James Griffith","asCharacter":"Constable Jasper Becketas Constable Jasper Becket…"},{"id":"nm0000385","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMTU0NTk4NDgzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU5Nzc1._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"Sam Elliott","asCharacter":"Canopus McKillenas Canopus McKillen…"},{"id":"nm0572522","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BZWQ5NjZiN2EtOWNiNy00MGZjLWI5NDMtZGZkMTMxYmJhYjI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMzI5NDcxNzI@._V1_Ratio1.0000_AL_.jpg","name":"David McLean","asCharacter":"Sheriffas Sheriff…"},{"id":"nm0225741","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BMjJlODBjZTAtYmQzYy00ZjEwLTk0MzUtYjQ0ZjRhMjkzMzg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjUyNDk2ODc@._V1_Ratio1.2143_AL_.jpg","name":"Charles Dierkop","asCharacter":"Bleakeras Bleaker…"},{"id":"nm0805490","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/MV5BNzk1OTQ0NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTY5Nzg3MjE@._V1_Ratio1.3429_AL_.jpg","name":"Richard X.
