Peter now has super spider powers and is so preoccupied with their possibilities that he fails to help the police stop a thief, who later robs the house of Peter's guardians, Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and kills Ben. Furious, Peter tracks down the culprit at a warehouse, and, on seeing the man's face, Peter realizes that if he had acted earlier to help stop the crook, Ben would be alive now. So, Peter vows to use his new powers to fight crime, as the super-heroic Spider-Man.","plotLocal":"","plotLocalIsRtl":false,"awards":"","directors":"","directorList":[],"writers":"","writerList":[],"stars":"Paul Soles, Peg Dixon, Paul Kligman","starList":[{"id":"nm0813015","name":"Paul Soles"},{"id":"nm0228944","name":"Peg Dixon"},{"id":"nm0459470","name":"Paul Kligman"}],"actorList":[{"id":"nm0813015","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Soles","asCharacter":"Spider-Manas Spider-Man…"},{"id":"nm0228944","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Peg Dixon","asCharacter":"Betty Brantas Betty Brant…"},{"id":"nm0459470","image":"https://imdb-api.com/images/original/nopicture.jpg","name":"Paul Kligman","asCharacter":"J.
